Luthen Rael’s shadowy legacy is further unpacked, showing him as a divisive figure within the Rebellion, comparable to Saw Gerrera.</p>\n<p>Fans are treated to appearances by Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, Admiral Raddus, and General Merrick. Flashbacks reveal Luthen’s past in the Imperial Infantry, while Nemik’s manifesto, now circulating galaxy-wide, is even heard by ISB officials like Partagaz.</p>\n<p>The finale includes deep-cut references, from Twi’lek kalikoris to a possible Gungan skull displayed in Luthen’s gallery.

The incident is cited as a key moment in growing concerns over Biden’s mental fitness during his re-election campaign.</p>\n<p>As reported by <em>Variety</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>, Clooney — who had last seen Biden at the 2022 Kennedy Center Honors — was “shaken” when the president failed to identify him without prompting at the high-profile event. The fundraiser, co-headlined by Clooney and Julia Roberts, raised at least $28 million for the Biden campaign.</p>\n<p>Clooney had already expressed concerns about Biden’s health, including reports from a White House aide about efforts to improve his mobility. But the 2024 encounter led Clooney to believe the problem was “much graver.”</p>\n<p>The book also describes Biden as appearing “slow and almost catatonic” during the event, displaying noticeable signs of cognitive decline. The incident, combined with Biden’s poor June 27 debate performance, reportedly prompted Clooney to write a New York Times op-ed urging him to withdraw from the race.</p>\n<p><em>Original Sin</em>, published by Penguin Press, is set for release on May 20 and offers a behind-the-scenes look at internal Democratic concerns leading up to Biden’s eventual exit from the 2024 presidential race.</p>\n"

She provided photos of bruises and dental injuries as evidence.</p>\n<p>In March, Bailey said Granberry entered her home while she was away and texted a threatening photo of her bed. Days later, she claimed he destroyed her Ring camera during a dispute and slammed a car door on her while she was holding their child.</p>\n<p>She also asked the court to bar Granberry from using his social platforms to incite harassment, saying his public remarks about her have triggered threats and hate online.</p>\n<p>Granberry has not publicly responded to the claims.

        "content": "\n<p>Actors Alison Brie and Dave Franco are facing a copyright infringement lawsuit over their upcoming film <em>Together</em>, which premiered at Sundance and was acquired by Neon for a reported $17 million. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, accuses Brie, Franco, and others of copying the 2023 indie film <em>Better Half</em>, citing shared plot points and thematic similarities.</p>\n<p>According to <em>Variety</em>, <em>Better Half</em> was written and directed by Patrick Henry Phelan and produced by StudioFest, the sole plaintiff. The film is a surreal romantic comedy about a couple who wake up physically fused after a one-night stand. In August 2020, a pitch for the project was sent to Franco and Brie’s agents at WME, but was declined.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that <em>Together</em> not only replicates the central concept but also specific scenes, including one where the couple is joined at the genitals while trying to hide it from another character. Both films also reportedly end with the couple pulling out a vinyl copy of the Spice Girls’ <em>Spiceworld</em> album as they accept their fate.</p>\n<p>Named defendants include Brie, Franco, WME, Neon, and writer-director Michael Shanks. StudioFest alleges the couple turned down the pitch in order to develop a similar project independently with a WME-affiliated writer.</p>\n<p>A WME spokesperson called the lawsuit “frivolous and without merit,” adding that they plan to “vigorously defend” against the claims. <em>Together</em> is scheduled for release on August 1.</p>\n"

The concept comes amid a wider rollout of his fashion brand, SKYLRK, which he has been teasing with images of neon apparel, sandals, and behind-the-scenes shots of the creative process.</p>\n<p>The singer acknowledged Hailey’s role in the product's inception, writing, “Turns out she has this tech patented so if I want to make this case I’ll have to pay her a fee.” Hailey responded to the post with, “I’ll think about it!”</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJml47-vTSy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"><svg><g><g><g><path></path></g></g></g></svg></a></div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJml47-vTSy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">View this post on Instagram</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJml47-vTSy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>The Rhode Lip Case became a breakout item after its launch, retailing for $38 and gaining popularity on social media.

Control groups received no bioplastic exposure.</p>\n<p>The researchers found plastic-related chemicals in the liver, ovaries, and intestines of exposed mice. These caused microlesions, organ abnormalities, gut microbiota disruption, and affected metabolic and genetic pathways.</p>\n<p>The changes were more severe in mice exposed to higher levels of bioplastics. Disruptions in gut bacteria were linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and alterations in glucose levels.</p>\n<p>The researchers said their study is the first to confirm the adverse effects of long-term exposure to bioplastics in mice, and urged further investigation into potential risks for humans.</p>\n<p>Plastic, including bioplastics, can shed into the environment as microplastics and micro-bioplastics, and previous studies have raised concerns about their presence in food and water.</p>\n<p>Despite their green image, bioplastics do not break down as quickly or as safely as often advertised, and the sector remains poorly regulated in terms of chemical safety.</p>\n<p>More than 2.5 million metric tonnes of bioplastics were produced globally last year, a figure expected to more than double in five years, according to industry estimates.</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>British luxury brand Burberry announced plans on Wednesday to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally — nearly one-fifth of its workforce as part of a wide-ranging cost-cutting and brand reset strategy following a steep drop in profits.</p>\n<p>The cuts, to be implemented by 2027, will primarily affect corporate roles across global offices, as well as the removal of the night shift at Burberry’s Castleford factory in Yorkshire, which produces its iconic trench coats. About 150 positions are expected to be impacted at the factory, which Burberry says had been operating with overcapacity.</p>\n<p>The decision comes as Burberry reported an adjusted operating profit of £26 million for the fiscal year ending March 29 2025 significantly down from £634 million in 2023 but still ahead of analyst expectations of £11 million. The company also recorded a statutory pre-tax loss of £66 million, compared to a profit of £383 million the year before.</p>\n<p>Shares in the company rose by as much as 8% in early London trading following the strategy update and better-than-expected results.</p>\n<p>CEO Joshua Schulman, who joined Burberry in 2023 after stints at Coach and Jimmy Choo, said the overhaul was necessary to tackle “years of underperformance” compared to its global luxury rivals. He noted that “brand metrics” had improved in the second half of the year, though challenges remained.</p>\n<p>“For a long time we have had overcapacity at Castleford and that’s simply not sustainable at this point,” Schulman said. “We are making this change to safeguard our UK manufacturing.”</p>\n<p>Burberry has cycled through four CEOs in the past decade. Under Marco Gobbetti and designer Riccardo Tisci, the brand shifted toward high-end luxury. That direction faltered financially, leading successor Jonathan Akeroyd to pivot toward leather accessories and bringing in designer Daniel Lee.</p>\n<p>Schulman, in contrast, is steering the company back to its heritage staples trench coats and scarves — while aggressively cutting costs. A previous £40 million savings plan announced in November is now being expanded to £60 million.</p>\n<p>Comparable fourth-quarter sales fell 6%, outperforming analyst expectations of a 7% decline. Full-year revenue dropped 15% when adjusted for currency fluctuations. Regionally, sales were down 4% in both the Americas and EMEIA (Europe, Middle East, India and Africa), and 9% in Asia-Pacific.</p>\n<p>Schulman acknowledged signs of weakening consumer sentiment in the US, which accounts for 19% of Burberry’s business. As we got into Q4, the US customer was keeping their momentum but things got a little choppy as we headed into February, he told reporters.</p>\n<p>While Burberry did not comment directly on US tariffs, it warned that geopolitical developments were contributing to increased uncertainty. The company declined to provide specific guidance for its 2026 financial year.</p>\n<p>Despite the tough environment, Schulman struck an optimistic note: “We have a strong brand and clear vision, and I believe Burberry’s best days are ahead</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>The sequel to Illumination and Nintendo’s blockbuster <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> is officially titled <em>Super Mario World</em>, according to a press release by NBCUniversal outlining its upcoming film slate. The sequel is scheduled for theatrical release on 3 April 2026.</p>\n<p>Following the first film’s commercial success, a sequel was confirmed soon after, though details remained limited until now. An end-credit scene in the 2023 film teased Yoshi’s arrival, and NBCUniversal’s slate confirms his expanded role in the sequel.</p>\n<p>As reported by <em>NintendoJam</em>, the title <em>Super Mario World</em> pays homage to the iconic 1990 SNES game, which marked Yoshi’s first appearance in the Mario franchise. The title suggests the film may draw heavily from that game, with Yoshi expected to take centre stage.</p>\n<p><em>Super Mario World</em> is being produced by Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri alongside Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto, the original creator of Mario. Returning to direct are Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, with Matthew Fogel once again handling the screenplay.</p>\n<p>With the title and release date now confirmed, fans can expect more updates as the film moves toward its 2026 premiere.</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p><strong>Erik and Lyle Menendez are scheduled to appear in court on 13 and 14 May 2025 for a resentencing hearing, more than three decades after being convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. The case has regained legal and public attention amid recent developments including a state-commissioned risk assessment.</strong></p>\n<p>The California Board of Parole's risk evaluation, conducted at the request of Governor Gavin Newsom as part of a separate clemency effort, concluded that the brothers pose a moderate risk to the community if released.</p>\n<p>The report detailed several violations, including possession of illegal mobile phones, with Erik Menendez allegedly caught with a phone as recently as January 2025. Other allegations include drug involvement and past assistance in committing tax fraud. Lyle Menendez was described by evaluators as exhibiting narcissistic traits.</p>\n<p>Judge Michael Jesic ruled that parts of the risk assessment could be considered in the resentencing hearing, although attorneys would not be permitted to question the forensic psychologists responsible for the findings.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has cited the report to oppose resentencing, while defence lawyer Mark Geragos argued the assessment should be limited to an upcoming parole hearing in June.</p>\n<p>The hearing will feature seven witnesses for the defence, including two expert testimonies. Geragos also dropped an effort to remove Hochman from the case after allegations of bias linked to public relations activities during his campaign.</p>\n<p>The brothers were originally sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Former DA George Gascón had previously supported resentencing them to 50 years to life, taking into account their ages at the time of the crime and their conduct in prison. Under this revised sentence, they would become eligible for parole immediately.</p>\n<p>Over 20 family members have expressed support for the brothers’ release. Jesic’s decision in the upcoming hearing may determine whether their sentences are revised or remain unchanged after 35 years in custody.</p>\n"

Trust yourself.”</p>\n<p>The cryptic post drew a heartfelt reply from Renner: “Long way from the ICU…. At least we know how this story ends my brother.

        "content": "\n<figure>\n<figcaption><span>Listen to article</span></figcaption>\n<audio></audio>\n</figure>\n<p>Amid ongoing efforts by Indian media to dismiss Pakistan’s claim of having neutralised two Indian S-400 air defence systems, a local Indian news outlet has lent unexpected weight to the Pakistani narrative.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the news website First Bihar Jharkhand reported the death of an Indian military official during last week’s hostilities with Pakistan. The report suggested that the official, Rambabu Kumar Singh, might have been an S-400 system operator.</p>\n<p>“Army jawan Rambabu Kumar Singh, a resident of Bihar’s Siwan district, was killed late Monday evening,” stated a translated excerpt from the original Hindi report.</p>\n<p>Citing Singh’s father-in-law, the outlet noted that Singh used to operate the S-400 air defence system and had reported for duty in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir on April 10.</p>\n<p>However, the report claimed he was killed by Pakistan Army fire around 1:30 PM on Monday.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The post says Bihar's son Rambabu Singh was killed in the recent Pakistan-India conflict. It says Rambabu used to operate S400 air defense system. This has confirmed that Pakistan indeed hit S400 air defense system during its retaliation! <a href=\"https://t.co/YyaoHinyAd\">https://t.co/YyaoHinyAd</a></p>\n— Kamran Yousaf (@Kamran_Yousaf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kamran_Yousaf/status/1922377632135442442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>According to multiple reports citing Pakistani security sources, Pakistan targeted and neutralised two of India’s S-400 air defence systems during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.</p>\n<p>One of the systems was reportedly stationed at the Adampur air base, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited on Tuesday. The other was reportedly deployed at the Udhampur air base in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).</p>\n<p>During his visit to Adampur, Modi posed in front of an S-400 missile launcher — a photo-op that Indian media framed as a “fact-check” of Pakistan’s claim.</p>\n<p>However, the image may have inadvertently supported Pakistan’s narrative, primarily because of what it failed to show.</p>\n<p>Experts note that if Pakistan had indeed neutralised any part of the S-400 system, it would likely have targeted the radar module or the command-and-control unit rather than the missile launchers themselves.</p>\n<p>A single S-400 battery typically includes multiple launchers, a surveillance radar, an engagement radar, and a command-and-control unit.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't think there's any real evidence of Pakistani success against the S-400 but on the other hand presumably Pakistan is at least as likely if not more likely to target the command center or the radar than they are the launcher. Perhaps those systems are in other photos. <a href=\"https://t.co/1yrBmjcQLY\">https://t.co/1yrBmjcQLY</a></p>\n— Christopher Clary (@clary_co) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clary_co/status/1922209113334755834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Pakistan is believed to have targeted the S-400 systems using precision-guided CM-400AKG hypersonic missiles launched from JF-17 fighter aircraft.</p>\n<p>The CM-400AKG uses a combined inertial and satellite navigation guidance system, and can be equipped with a passive radar seeker in its terminal phase. </p>\n<p>Passive radar homing is a missile guidance method that enables a missile to detect and track a target without emitting its own radar signal.</p>\n<p>Unlike active radar homing, which relies on the missile sending out signals and receiving their reflections, passive radar homing uses a built-in receiver to detect radio frequency emissions.</p>\n<p>These signals can originate from the target itself — such as radar, communications, or other electronic emissions — or from an external transmitter associated with the target.</p>\n<p>This allows the missile to home in on the target covertly, without alerting it to the missile’s presence.</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>In a New York court on Tuesday, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura delivered emotional testimony during the ongoing sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, alleging years of abuse, coercion, and control throughout their long-term relationship.</p>\n<p>Testifying as a key prosecution witness, Ventura described their on-and-off relationship, which began when she was 19 and Combs was 37. She told jurors that what began as a seemingly monogamous relationship quickly turned controlling. According to <em>BBC News</em>, Ventura said Combs paid for her home, vehicles, and electronics, but also used those resources as tools of punishment and manipulation.</p>\n<p>Ventura alleged that Combs became physically abusive, describing incidents where he \"bashed her head,\" dragged her, and left her with visible injuries including black eyes and swollen lips. She said Combs coerced her into “freak-offs” — sexual encounters with male escorts that he observed. According to Ventura, these encounters sometimes lasted several days and took place in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Las Vegas, and Ibiza.</p>\n<p>She said Combs controlled every detail of the encounters, from the clothing she wore to the acts performed. Ventura also testified that she used marijuana, ecstasy, and ketamine to numb herself and “disassociate” during these events.</p>\n<p>Combs has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Ventura is expected to continue her testimony on Wednesday.</p>\n"

A parole board hearing is already scheduled for June 13 as part of a clemency request submitted to Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether that hearing will double as their formal parole review.</p>\n<p>Legal analyst Anne Bremner said the brothers will face pressure to demonstrate their rehabilitation. “My guess is the parole board has been watching this… They know what the crimes were and what the brothers have done since incarceration.”</p>\n<p>If parole is granted, Newsom has the authority to overturn the decision. Alternatively, if parole is denied, the brothers will continue to receive future hearings.</p>\n<p>Separately, a 2023 habeas corpus petition citing new evidence of sexual abuse remains pending, with prosecutors having filed a motion to oppose it.</p>\n<p>The Menendez brothers' story has seen renewed public interest thanks to the Netflix drama <em>Monsters: Lyle and Erik Menendez Story</em> and a 2024 documentary.</p>\n<p>The case continues to provoke debate about justice, abuse, and redemption.</p>\n"

He also urged the government to immediately convene Parliament for a detailed discussion on the operation, the ceasefire deal, and the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that triggered the escalation.</p>\n<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi echoed the demands, calling for an all-party meeting and criticising the Modi administration's decision-making. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge questioned the lack of strategic clarity and demanded the government present a full account to the nation. AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar criticised the reliance on foreign mediation, warning that India’s diplomatic autonomy may be undermined.</p>\n<p>While opposition figures across the spectrum voiced concern, some like Congress MP Shashi Tharoor adopted a more nuanced stance. Tharoor described the ceasefire as a “necessary recalibration” to prevent deeper conflict, even if strategic goals were not fully met. RJD’s Manoj Jha, however, warned against allowing foreign intervention to become a precedent, backing Gandhi’s call for a special Parliament session.</p>\n"

Some users on X (formerly Twitter) criticised the move, while others called the ban lifting 'long overdue.'</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So is there no lifetime ban for betting on baseball? Is it no longer MLBs cardinal sin? These bans should remain. It makes no sense to suddenly lift them after all this time, as if the bans were wrongly given but we're only finding it out now. Also, it's ridiculous to do this…</p>\n— Nick in the D 👊 (@NickInTheD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickInTheD/status/1922396004835590301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Waited til they died to lift the ban. What a joke.</p>\n— Jerm (@IamJerm24) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IamJerm24/status/1922385091994571065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Way overdue. Was Pete rose an all around great guy? Probably not but the talent was there and he was among the all time greatest players in baseball history. Should’ve been in the hall years ago</p>\n— Erick (@EKlambara) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EKlambara/status/1922388407692521614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>Rose will now be eligible for nomination to the Hall of Fame’s Classic Baseball Era Committee in 2027, but would still require 12 of 16 votes from a panel including former players, executives, writers and historians.</p>\n<p>The Hall of Fame has yet to confirm whether it will amend its 1991 rule disqualifying players with permanent bans, leaving Rose’s actual induction far from certain.</p>\n"

Meanwhile, some fire departments face delivery delays of up to four years.</p>\n<p>\"It's really a critical hazard in public safety,\" IAFF President Edward Kelly said.</p>\n<p>The IAFF and antimonopoly group American Economic Liberties Project (AELP) urged the FTC to launch a market study and the DOJ to consider enforcement action.</p>\n<p>They warned that inflated costs and long lead times are undermining emergency response capabilities, especially in cities grappling with natural disasters.</p>\n<p>Fire departments, they said, are increasingly locked into contracts with “floating” pricing — where final costs can rise after an order is placed.</p>\n<p>“We are paying the price for all these corporate decisions,” Kelly said. “It serves the investor well, but it doesn’t serve the public when you call 911 and the ladder truck is out of service.”</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Oshkosh said the company is investing in manufacturing capacity, technology and process improvements to meet growing demand.</p>\n<p>REV Group cited labour shortages, inflation, and pandemic-related disruptions as drivers of cost and delay, but said it has boosted production by 30% in two years and launched faster-delivery models.</p>\n<p>Rosenbauer said its backlog is shorter than the industry average and that it is also increasing output.</p>\n<p>Kelly added that fire departments are experiencing the knock-on effects of consolidation in other areas — from dispatch software to vehicle parts and personal protective equipment.</p>\n<p>The IAFF cited recent wildfires in California where dozens of fire trucks were reportedly unavailable, contributing to the deaths of at least 29 people in two communities.</p>\n"

The deceased included two three-year-old girls, seven women, and four men. In addition, 37 individuals were injured, including nine women and 28 men.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident near Muzaffarabad, a strike on Bilal Mosque resulted in three fatalities, while two children — a girl and a boy — sustained injuries, he added.</p>\n<p>Another attack occurred in Kotli, where the Abbas Mosque was targeted. Two teenagers, a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy, were martyred. A woman and her daughter were also injured in the same incident.</p>\n<p>He further stated that no casualties were reported in Sialkot or Shakargarh, although a dispensary in Shakargarh sustained minor damage.</p>\n<p>The military spokesperson also confirmed that Indian army firing along the Line of Control martyred five civilians, including a five-year-old child.</p>\n<p>The military spokesperson added that India deliberately targeted mosques, describing it as a reflection of the extremist mindset of Narendra Modi’s Hindutva-driven government, which, he said, systematically oppresses minorities—particularly Muslims.</p>\n<p>He further said that Pakistan army downed five Indian fighter jets and one combat drone in response to unprovoked aggression and airspace violations.</p>\n<p>According to the military spokesperson, the aircraft shot down included three Rafale jets, one MiG-29, one SU-series aircraft, and an Israeli-made Heron combat drone. The jets were downed in multiple locations, including Bhatinda, Jammu, Akhnoor, Srinagar, and Avantipur.</p>\n<p>“The Pakistan Air Force engaged these aircraft only after they carried out attacks on Pakistani territory,” DG ISPR said. “Their aggression targeted the territorial integrity of Pakistan and endangered civilian lives,” he added.</p>\n<p>The military spokesperson added that while Pakistani forces had the capability to strike more than ten aircraft, they chose to exercise restraint.</p>\n<p>He further said that armed forces responded to Indian airstrikes in a “measured and defensive” manner, asserting that the response was carried out in self-defence and without violating Indian airspace.</p>\n<p><strong>'Dam targeting dangerous escalation'</strong></p>\n<p>In a press briefing, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry stated that India also targeted Nauseri Dam, part of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower project. The military termed the move a “dangerous escalation” and warned of its implications.</p>\n<p>“This is an unacceptable act,” DG ISPR said. “Targeting water infrastructure raises serious questions about compliance with international humanitarian law and war conventions.”</p>\n<p>He also said the Indian strikes endangered civil aviation, with 57 international flights passing through Pakistani airspace at the time of the incident. “The presence of civilian aircraft highlights the recklessness of this operation,” he noted.</p>\n<p>He added that Pakistani aircraft did not cross into Indian airspace, and no Indian aircraft were allowed into Pakistani territory.</p>\n<p>“Pakistan has the right to respond to any act of aggression in a manner and time of its choosing,” Lt. Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the armed forces remain committed to defending the country’s sovereignty.</p>\n"

The deceased included two three-year-old girls, seven women, and four men. In addition, 37 individuals were injured, including nine women and 28 men.</p>\n<p>In a separate incident near Muzaffarabad, a strike on Bilal Mosque resulted in three fatalities, while two children — a girl and a boy — sustained injuries, he added.</p>\n<p>Another attack occurred in Kotli, where the Abbas Mosque was targeted. Two teenagers, a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy, were martyred, the DG ISPR said.</p>\n<p>He further said that Pakistan army downed five Indian fighter jets and one combat drone in response to unprovoked aggression and airspace violations.</p>\n<p>According to the military spokesperson, the aircraft shot down included three Rafale jets, one MiG-29, one SU-series aircraft, and an Israeli-made Heron combat drone. The jets were downed in multiple locations, including Bhatinda, Jammu, Akhnoor, Srinagar, and Avantipur.</p>\n<p>“The Pakistan Air Force engaged these aircraft only after they carried out attacks on Pakistani territory,” DG ISPR said. “Their aggression targeted the territorial integrity of Pakistan and endangered civilian lives,” he added.</p>\n<p>The military spokesperson added that while Pakistani forces had the capability to strike more than ten aircraft, they chose to exercise restraint.</p>\n<p>He further said that armed forces responded to Indian airstrikes in a “measured and defensive” manner, asserting that the response was carried out in self-defence and without violating Indian airspace.</p>\n<p>In a press briefing, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry stated that India also targeted Nauseri Dam, part of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. The military termed the move a “dangerous escalation” and warned of its implications.</p>\n<p>“This is an unacceptable act,” DG ISPR said. “Targeting water infrastructure raises serious questions about compliance with international humanitarian law and war conventions.”</p>\n<p>He also said the Indian strikes endangered civil aviation, with 57 international flights passing through Pakistani airspace at the time of the incident. “The presence of civilian aircraft highlights the recklessness of this operation,” he noted.</p>\n<p>He added that Pakistani aircraft did not cross into Indian airspace, and no Indian aircraft were allowed into Pakistani territory.</p>\n<p>“Pakistan has the right to respond to any act of aggression in a manner and time of its choosing,” Lt. Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the armed forces remain committed to defending the country’s sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Earlier, security forces said that Pakistan destroyed an Indian Army infantry brigade headquarters in response to Indian aggression, according to sources. Footage of the destroyed Indian brigade headquarters has surfaced following the Pakistani strike, security sources said.</p>\n<p>The targeted Indian unit was the 12th Infantry Brigade, operating under the 9th Division of the Indian Army’s 15 Corps, the sources confirmed.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari denounced the Indian missile strikes, describing them as an unprovoked act of aggression and a clear breach of international law. He said the attacks reflected the true face of India’s fascist regime, which prioritises political ambitions over regional peace and international norms.</p>\n<p>In his statement, President Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and assured that the armed forces are fully prepared to counter any further hostilities.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned India’s recent attacks on Pakistani territory, calling them cowardly strikes carried out by a \"cunning enemy\" at six different locations. He asserted that Pakistan reserves the right to respond decisively to the war imposed by India and confirmed that a strong and appropriate response is already underway.</p>\n<p>Expressing solidarity with the armed forces, the Prime Minister stated that the entire nation stands united behind them. He added that both the public and the military are fully capable of confronting the enemy and will never allow hostile plans to succeed.</p>\n<p>AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq strongly condemned India’s overnight strikes, calling the action cowardly and consistent with past patterns. “As per its tradition, India carried out attacks under the cover of darkness on two locations in Azad Kashmir—Kotli and Muzaffarabad,” he stated.</p>\n<p>He confirmed that a woman and a child were martyred in the Kotli attack. “God willing, we will give a strong and united response to Indian aggression in coordination with the Pakistan Armed Forces,” he vowed.</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJU8F59tLG2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\"><svg><g><g><g><path></path></g></g></g></svg></a></div>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJU8F59tLG2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">View this post on Instagram</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJU8F59tLG2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\">A post shared by The Express Tribune (@etribune)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Visual evidence from the affected areas reportedly confirmed that only non-combatants were struck. “The images clearly show that only innocent Pakistanis were targeted,” said the officials.</p>\n<p>The Indian Ministry of Defence has officially confirmed that it carried out airstrikes inside Pakistan. In a statement, the ministry claimed that Indian forces targeted nine separate locations across Pakistan. However, it did not provide specific details about the exact sites or the nature of the targets.</p>\n<p>A red alert was issued at New Islamabad International Airport, security sources added. Sources confirmed that all flight operations at the airport have been suspended, and Pakistani airspace in the region has been closed to commercial aircraft.</p>\n<p>“Some time ago from now, the cowardly enemy India launched air strikes on Subhanullah mosque in Bahwalpur’s Ahmed East area, Kotli and Muzaffarabad at three places from the air,” DG ISPR said during a late-night press briefing on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>He added that the Pakistan Air Force had scrambled jets in response to the attack. “All of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India’s airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.”</p>\n<p>Issuing a stern warning, the military spokesperson stated: “Let me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”</p>\n<p>When asked about possible casualties and infrastructure damage, DG Chaudhry noted that assessment efforts were ongoing and promised to share further details once confirmed.</p>\n<p>Local sources further stated that a complete blackout occurred in Muzaffarabad following the explosions, raising concerns about the extent of damage and the ongoing security situation.</p>\n<p>In light of recent developments, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had issued a stark warning, stating that a clash with India is now \"inevitable\" and could occur \"at any moment.\" His remarks come amid growing fears of direct military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>\n<p>The incident follows weeks of heightened tensions after a deadly attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which New Delhi has blamed on Pakistan—an accusation Islamabad strongly denies.</p>\n"

The move comes barely days after New Delhi unilaterally suspended the World Bank-brokered Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Express News reported on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The Chenab river – one of the three western rivers allocated to Pakistan under the 65-year-old treaty – saw a drastic and abrupt surge in water flow. According to Express News, the inflow at Head Marala was recorded at just 3,100 cusecs at 9pm on Monday. By Tuesday, it had surged to 26,000 cusecs - a dramatic and unexplained increase within a matter of hours.</p>\n<p>Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada confirmed the \"unnatural change\" in the river's flow.</p>\n<p>\"We have witnessed changes in the river [Chenab] which are not natural at all,\" Pirzada told AFP. \"One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,\" he added. \"The majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,\" he said about its impact.</p>\n<p>According to daily data shared by the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), a total of 132,000 cusecs of water was released from various rim stations, while the inflow stood at 188,800 cusecs. The data also indicated that 7,700 cusecs of water was released from the Chenab River at Marala.</p>\n<p>The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT}, signed in 1960 between Pakistan and India, permits India to use the shared rivers for irrigation purposes but prohibits it from diverting watercourses or altering downstream flows. However, on April 23, India unilaterally suspended the treaty, citing Pakistan's alleged involvement in the killing of 26 tourists in Pahalgam.</p>\n<p>In response, Pakistan warned India that tampering with its rivers would be considered \"an act of war\". On Tuesday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar repeated the warning while speaking in the National Assembly. \"Any attempt to divert Pakistan's water resources would trigger a strong response.\"</p>\n<p>On Monday, according to a Reuters report, India started \"reservoir flushing\" process at the Salal and Baglihar projects on the Chenab River in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). The activity was carried out without informing Pakistan - a requirement under the IWT.</p>\n<p>The reservoir flushing process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, according to an Indian newspaper report, the gates of the sluice spillways on the Baglihar dam were lowered to restrict water flow as a short-term punitive action. The Punjab irrigation minister said that this was being done \"so that we don't get to utilise the water\".</p>\n<p>Experts said the water cannot be stopped in the longer term, and that India could only regulate timings of when it releases flows. However, the Jinnah Institute warned: \"Even small changes in the timing of water releases can disrupt sowing calendars (and) reduce crop yields\".</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, according to another Reuters report, India advanced the start date of four under-construction hydropower projects in IIOJK by months. Quoting sources, the report said that the updated schedule was another sign of India trying to take advantage of its unilateral suspension of the IWT.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government had asked authorities to clear hurdles to speedy construction of four hydro projects with a combined capacity of 3,014 megawatts, according to the document, an undated list made by the power ministry and reviewed by Reuters.</p>\n<p>In a speech in New Delhi, Modi said that water from IIOJK would be stopped from flowing across the borders. \"India's water will be stopped for India's interests, and it will be utilised for India,\" he said.</p>\n<p>The four projects are Pakal Dul, 1,000 MW; Kiru, 624 MW; Kwar, 540 MW; and Ratle, 850 MW. All of them are on the Chenab River, whose waters are mainly meant for Pakistan. India's State-run NHPC is asked to start the work between June 2026 and August 2028, the document showed.</p>\n<p>Pakistan and India are already in dispute over Ratle in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The dispute is about the pondage, or small water storage area, the turbine design and some other specifications. In total, India wanted work expedited on a total of seven projects, the report stated.

Later, a new cause list was issued, which said that both judges would not be part of the bench for further hearing of the petitions.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the PTI would get the reserved seats in the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies as per its strength in these houses. The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has sought review of the decision.</p>\n<p>The petitions were heard by the 13-member bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan. During the hearing, the judges raised questions regarding the non-implementation of the Supreme Court's original decision, delivered on July 12, 2024.</p>\n<p>Haris Azmat, the lawyer for the PML-N, argued that the reserved seats had been given to a party that was not even a party to the case. On that Justice Malik remarked that this point had been answered in the judgment. She then asked the lawyer to apprise the court of the basis of the petition.</p>\n<p>Justice Malik said that the apex court's decision was given after hearing all the points in detail. She asked the lawyer whether or not the court's decision was implemented. Justice Abbasi remarked that there was a contempt of court petition for non-implementation of the decision.</p>\n<p>To a query from Justice Hashim Kakar, ECP lawyer Sikandar Bashir Mohmand told the court that the ECP had partially implemented the decision. On that, Justice Malik remarked that the ECP could not pick and choose in implementing the court decision.</p>\n<p>Later, the court adjourned the hearing until Wednesday (today).The bench accepted the review petitions for initial hearing with a majority of 11-2, and issued notices to the parties concerned. The bench also issued notices on the contempt of court petition filed against the ECP.</p>\n<p>Justice Malik and Justice Abbasi gave dissenting opinion and dismissed the petitions as inadmissible at the first hearing. Justice Malik said that she dismissed the three review petitions as inadmissible and would issue detailed reasons later. Justice Abbasi remarked that he agreed with Justice Malik.</p>\n<p>Later, a new cause list was issued on the Supreme Court website, according to which, an 11-member CB, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, would hear the petitions. Justice Malik and Justice Abbasi were not included in the bench.</p>\n<p>However, Kanwal Shauzab's petition to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the ECP for non-implementation of the court decision was not scheduled for hearing in the new cause list. In the previous cause list, this petition was included for hearing on Wednesday.</p>\n"

He expressed scepticism that the bench may suspend the majority judgment, authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.</p>\n<p>The counsel further questioned the bench for providing only one day for preparation, suggesting that such haste is unusual and raises concerns.</p>\n<p>It is crucial to note that if the Constitutional Bench suspends the order, reserved seats will again be allocated to the ruling political parties, particularly PMLN and PPP.</p>\n<p>There is also strong speculation within the bar that the executive might be planning another constitutional amendment to consolidate its dominance over the superior judiciary, suppress dissenting voices within the institution, and facilitate the elevation of 'like-minded judges.'</p>\n<p>Though the ruling parties could introduce an amendment without addressing the issue of reserved seats, the recent acceptance of a review in the Article 63A case allows the vote of defecting lawmakers to be counted.</p>\n<p>Two judges, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, who had dismissed the review petitions, have been excluded from the larger bench by the committee led by Justice Aminuddin Khan.</p>\n<p>This committee includes Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazahar.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Justice Mazahar was a signatory to the majority decision and also to two clarifications issued by the majority judges, led by Justice Shah, during the tenure of former CJP Qazi Faez Isa.</p>\n<p>Despite this, he agreed with the majority of judges who have now issued notices to respondents in the reserved seats case. He did not provide any remarks regarding the merit of the case during Tuesday's hearing.</p>\n<p>Advocate Abdul Moiz Jaferii and witness to the court proceedings in courtroom No. 1, remarked that it was extraordinary for the hearing to take place without the involvement of the authored judge, Justice Shah.</p>\n<p>Jaferii highlighted that it was remarkable that the judge leading the hearing had been censured by the majority in the original decision, now under review. He also pointed out that notices were issued in a review where the regulator is openly in violation of the judgment it seeks to have reviewed.</p>\n<p>Lawyers believe this case will be a litmus test for the bench's ability to uphold the authority of the apex court. The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has deliberately defied the Supreme Court's judgment.</p>\n<p>Legal experts argue that judges must demonstrate their commitment to respecting each other's decisions, as failure to do so will grant the executive a free pass to disobey judicial rulings.</p>\n<p>Since the passage of the 26th Amendment, the executive has gained significant dominance over the judiciary, a move that could not have been possible without internal support for the present regime. Now, judges sympathetic to the current government are at the helm, while those not aligned with the government have been sidelined.</p>\n<p>Judges of the Islamabad High Court, who have raised their voices against executive interference in judicial functions, are facing punitive measures in various forms.</p>\n<p>Senior judges are not stepping in to rescue them. However, Chief Justice Yahya Afridi has made it clear that transferred judges will be placed at the bottom of the seniority list in the Islamabad High Court.</p>\n<p>This case holds particular significance for the independence of the judiciary. It is widely understood that Justice Shah is being targeted for rendering the decision in the reserved seats case.</p>\n<p>All eyes are now on today's hearing of the reserved seats case, with expectations that some judges may again question the non-implementation of the decision by the ECP.</p>\n"

The sources said three civilians embraced martyrdom during the strikesone child died in Ahmedpur East in Bahawalpur district, sources said. Another child and a woman were martyred in Kotli, AJK Prime Minister Anwarul Haq said.</p>\n<p>The sources said that Pakistani forces were giving a befitting reply to the naked Indian aggression, while damage assessment was being carried out. \"According to initial reports, Pakistan Air Force has shot down three enemy aircraft, and all the PAF planes are safe,\" a source said.</p>\n<p>Pakistan Army also shot down an Indian drone in Barnala sector, the sources added.</p>\n<p>\"Our valiant forces are giving a befitting reply to the enemy at several places.

Videos of the spots clearly showed that only innocent and unarmed Pakistanis were targeted.</p>\n<p>Earlier, the military spokesperson, confirmed that India had conducted missile strikes. \"The Indian aircraft from their airspace have hit cities of Bahawalpur, Kotli and Muzaffarabad,\" Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) told a private television channel. He added that the airborne fighter jets of the PAF did not let the Indian aircraft enter the Pakistani airspace.</p>\n<p>The DG ISPR said that this cowardly and shameful attack would be met with a befitting reply and the choice of place and time for it will be at the discretion of Pakistan. The sources said that India had targeted innocent Pakistanis in a cowardly attack in the dark of night, adding that \"the blood of innocent Pakistanis will be avenged at all costs\".</p>\n<p>Following the strikes, the authorities closed the Islamabad airspace for all commercial flights, diverting three incoming planes to Peshawar. An emergency has been imposed in Rawalpindi hospitals and doctors and paramedics have been alerted.</p>\n<p>After the cowardly attack by the vile enemy India at five places in the dark of night, the airspace of New Islamabad International Airport was closed and three flights in the air were diverted to other airports including Peshawar.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement in the wake of India's attack, condemned the aggression, saying Pakistan reserves all rights to respond forcefully.</p>\n<p>\"The devious enemy has carried out cowardly attacks at five locations in Pakistan,\" he said, adding that a forceful response was being delivered.</p>\n<p>\"The entire nation stands with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and the morale and spirit of the Pakistani people are high,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He added that the people of Pakistan and the armed forces know well how to deal with the enemy. \"We will never allow the enemy to succeed in its nefarious designs.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced closure of educational institutions in the province.</p>\n<p>In a related development, a key meeting of the National Security Committee has been convened, according to Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.</p>\n<p>The minister said PM Shehbaz has summoned a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) at 10 am today. High-level consultations on the national security situation will be held, with major decisions regarding national security expected.</p>\n<p>\"A crucial meeting has been called to thwart the enemy's designs,\" the minister added.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif delivered a clear warning from the headquarters of the country's premier spy agency that any Indian attempt to violate Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be get a decisive response.</p>\n<p>Shehbaz visited the headquarters of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Islamabad along with senior cabinet members amid ongoing tensions with India.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Defence Minister, and the Services Chiefs in a carefully crafted move to convey a loud message to India that Pakistan was ready to deter any misadventure from across the border.</p>\n<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister Office said, at the ISI head office, a detailed briefing was given to participants on the prevailing security environment, with a particular focus on preparedness for conventional threat in the light of India's increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan's Eastern border.</p>\n"

However, the reduction in the super tax rate, which could cost Rs28 billion to the government, would depend upon finding other tax avenues, they added.</p>\n<p>The proposals are part of the government's taxation measures that it wants to introduce in the new budget to achieve the overall Rs14.3 trillion tax target in fiscal year 2025-26, according to the senior tax officials. The government is already charging 5% Federal Excise Duty (FED) on fertiliser, which it wants to double for generating additional around Rs50 billion in the next fiscal year, said the sources. They added that the 5% FED might also be introduced on the pesticides. One of the options was that instead of 5%, the duty on pesticides should also be 10% equal to the fertiliser rate.</p>\n<p>The government has already committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase taxes on agricultural inputs, leaving little room for reversal, even if the Pakistan Peoples Party opposes the move in the budget proposal, said the sources. The farmers have long been complaining to the government about the rising cost of their inputs coupled with their low quality. In its meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the PPP delegation on Monday had urged the government to prioritise the agriculture sector in the next budget to achieve economic growth.</p>\n<p>The agriculture sector is already struggling after the government abruptly withdrew the agriculture support price mechanism without timely intimating the farmers. The sector has been grappling with issues of climate change, limited water availability and insufficient reservoirs to store water, which is also now at the centre of India-Pakistan tensions.</p>\n<p>For the first time, the farmers will also pay income tax at rates ranging as high as 45% from the next fiscal year on the income that they earned from January onwards.</p>\n<p>At the time of negotiations for the $7 billion bailout package, the federal government had promised the IMF that it would end preferential treatments to reduce distortions. The government had explicitly committed with the IMF that \"its large-scale interventions in markets for agricultural commodities, including fertilisers, are no longer fit for purpose\" of ensuring food security.</p>\n<p>The low or no FED rate on the fertiliser and the pesticides are described as \"distortions stifling private sector activity and innovation, exacerbated price volatility and hoarding, and placed fiscal sustainability at risk.\"</p>\n<p>The IMF and the federal government think that the farmers excessively use fertilisers, which is polluting the environment.</p>\n<p>The sources said that the government was considering the possibility of reducing the super tax rate by 2% to 8%. The business community has long been demanding to completely abolish the current 10% super tax, which the government charges from high earner individuals and companies. However, due to its major contribution in the tax collection, the government is reluctant to completely abolish it.</p>\n<p>Some of the companies have also challenged the levy in the courts on the point of collecting it from the past.</p>\n<p>The government is planning to set the revenue collection target at Rs14.3 trillion or 11% of the GDP for the next fiscal year. The sources said that the IMF has already asked to propose tax measures to achieve this target. The discussions with the IMF will take place from May 14th. There is also a view in the government that the Rs14.3 trillion target can be achieved without taking additional measures, as the new target was 16% higher than this year's revised goals.</p>\n<p>SEZs</p>\n<p>The government also promised with the IMF that within 10 years, it will completely abolish the tax-free status of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ). As part of the commitment, the government plans to amend the tax laws in the budget to lower the tax-free status to nine years, starting from July, said the sources.</p>\n<p>Shehbaz Sharif's government has promised with the IMF that it will refrain from providing companies with fiscal incentives such as tax breaks or other subsidies.</p>\n<p>In another move, it has engaged the AT Kearney firm for conducting an assessment of the fiscal costs and effectiveness associated with each SEZ. The report will be ready before the end of June, said the sources.</p>\n<p>According to the plan, the government will not provide new fiscal incentives to any new or existing SEZ, and will not renew existing ones. By end-June 2025, the government will prepare a plan based on the assessment conducted to fully phase out all current SEZs incentives by 2035, subject to pre-existing contractual obligations.</p>\n<p>During the transition period between 2024 and 2035, the government will replace pre existing profit-based incentives with cost-based incentives, subject to compliance with existing legal commitments. For those cases where contractual provisions allow for early termination or renegotiation of existing SEZ incentives, Pakistan will phase out such incentives insofar as allowed by these legal provisions.</p>\n"

Members expressed concern over policy ambiguity, especially regarding trade with Iran, Russia, and Afghanistan under a barter system following banking restrictions with these countries.</p>\n<p>Senator Hamid Khan criticised the existence of separate policies for barter and traditional trade, calling it \"malicious,\" and asserting that \"global trade operates under a unified Import Policy Order (IPO).\" Meanwhile, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla highlighted the strategic importance of barter trade in curbing cross-border smuggling, stating, \"Barter trade with Iran and Afghanistan will help prevent smuggling.\"</p>\n<p>Traders impacted by the delays informed the committee that over 1,200 trucks loaded with goods under barter agreements, particularly sesame seeds and ricehave been stranded at the border due to procedural hurdles, with transactions conducted outside the dollar-based payment system. In response, the committee agreed to convene a joint meeting with the finance minister, commerce minister, and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor to resolve the impasse.</p>\n<p>Documents shared with the committee revealed that the Ministry of Commerce has finalised a draft summary proposing an exemption from Electronic Import Forms (EIF) for imports of Iranian-origin goods via land routes. The exemption, aimed at facilitating trade in the absence of formal banking channels, has been circulated among the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), SBP, and Finance Division for feedback before submission to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.</p>\n<p>According to the draft, the exemption from paragraph 3 of the Import Policy Order 2022 and EIF requirements under the SBP's Foreign Exchange Manual would apply solely to Iranian-origin goods imported by land, until banking channels are formally established. The exemption does not extend to non-Iranian-origin goods imported via Iran, due to the availability of regular banking arrangements with other countries.</p>\n<p>The FBR will oversee verification of the goods' origin under Section 79 of the Customs Act, 1969, and Rule 433-A of the Customs Rules, 2001. The current EIF exemption for Iranian imports is set to expire on May 15, 2025. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce is reviewing the existing barter trade framework and SROs in consultation with stakeholders to operationalise the system.</p>\n<p>Key decisions from recent meetings include aligning barter trade rules with the Import and Export Policy Orders 2022, eliminating the predefined list of tradable goods in SRO 642(I)/2023, and awaiting inputs from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on sanctioned entities. The FBR is also expected to propose amendments enabling credit transfers or netting of trade values under the barter system.</p>\n<p>The SBP, while acknowledging the necessity of EIF waivers given the absence of banking ties with Iran and Afghanistan, cautioned against potential misuse and recommended stronger controls in the WEBOC and Pakistan Single Window (PSW) systems to ensure only genuine traders benefit. The central bank further advised prioritising the operationalisation of the barter trade mechanism over continued reliance on EIF exemptions, which risk encouraging informal settlements.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Ministry of Commerce has proposed mandatory certificates of origin for all goods imported from Iran and Afghanistan, to ensure compliance with customs regulations and to prevent circumvention of import restrictions, particularly for high-risk goods.</p>\n<p>The committee also addressed the issue of illegal trade, including smuggling of tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and tyres. A subcommittee comprising Senators Zeeshan Khanzada, Sarmad Ali, and Faisal Rahman was formed to present recommendations on the tobacco sector. The issue of counterfeit medicines was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Health for further review.</p>\n<p>In a bid to modernise trade practices, the committee urged the Ministry of Commerce and trade associations, including towel manufacturers and the pharmaceutical industry, to adopt a digitised system introduced by private firm Galaxefi Solutions. On the committee's invitation, Galaxefi founder and CEO Asif Pervez delivered a detailed presentation on how the firm's automation and AI solutions could transform cross-border trade operations.</p>\n<p>Trade and Investment Officers (TIOs) of the Ministry of Commerce posted abroad also briefed the committee on emerging global trade opportunities, signalling Pakistan's continued commitment to expanding its international trade footprint.</p>\n"

However, he warned that any hopes of a sharp drop in interest rates purely due to an IMF qualification may be unrealistic.</p>\n<p>Responding to questions from The Express Tribune on the sidelines of the ADB's 58th Annual Meeting in Italy, the bank's chief economist said that an IMF deal acts as a \"signal\" of macroeconomic discipline and stability. \"If the IMF comes to an agreement with Pakistan, that's important for the ADB. It means we feel Pakistan is more fiscally sound,\" the official explained. However, they added that while such agreements impact lending confidence, they do not automatically translate into lower interest rates from multilateral agencies like the ADB.</p>\n<p>ADB lending decisions, he noted, are primarily based on a country's level of development and debt sustainability. \"We don't want to lend to countries with unsustainable debt burden. But once there is a reform agreement in place, it opens up avenues for deeper engagement,\" the official said.</p>\n<p>The ADB also weighed in on the ongoing debate in Pakistan about whether it should pursue protectionist industrial policies to shield local industriesat least in the short termbefore liberalising trade. Addressing this, the official said that while historical examples exist of countries like Japan, India and South Korea using temporary protectionism during their early industrial phases, in many cases such protection becomes entrenched.</p>\n<p>\"In theory, temporary protection might help an industry grow, but in practice, protections often become permanent due to vested political interests,\" Park warned. \"That leads to inefficiencies and higher costs, especially in today's globalised world where foreign direct investment depends on openness and predictability.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, ADB official stressed that Pakistan and other South Asian economies, including India and Bangladesh, should focus on boosting exports, improving ease of doing business, and attracting foreign investment. Trade liberalisation and participation in global value chains were identified as long-term strategies for sustained economic growth.</p>\n<p>On India, He said the country is well-positioned to benefit from shifting global supply chains, especially post-COVID. However, India needs to address infrastructure bottlenecks, reduce trade barriers, and improve its regulatory environment. \"India remains relatively protectionist,\" said Park, cautioning that high tariffs on intermediate goods could make domestic industries less competitive globally.</p>\n<p>In Bangladesh's case, officials noted that the country's slow integration into regional and multilateral trade blocs— such as ASEAN and RCEPlimits its export diversification potential. Currently, Bangladesh has only one bilateral trade pact, a preferential trade agreement (PTA) with Bhutan. ADB attributed this hesitation to fears of heightened competition, but stressed that greater openness could lead to long-term benefits.</p>\n<p>The ADB also flagged growing concerns over escalating trade tensions globally, particularly involving the United States and China. The bank's April outlook forecasted Asia's growth at 4.9% this year and 4.7% for 2026, admitting that those figures did not account for recent reciprocal tariffs announced by Washington.</p>\n<p>\"The uncertainty itself is harming investment and production across Asia,\" the official said. \"Increased volatility, especially from shifting trade policies, has led to a slowdown in manufacturing and weakened business confidence.\"</p>\n"

The FBATI has condemned the measures, calling it a serious infringement on operational freedom and a new layer of bureaucratic intrusion.</p>\n<p>\"Having tax officers embedded in our workplaces is not only invasive but amounts to institutional harassment,\" said the FBATI president. \"This legislation undermines constitutional rights, weakens the role of the judiciary, and creates a hostile environment for current and potential investors.\"</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, during a high-level meeting held at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Tuesday, both KCCI and the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) unanimously rejected the controversial Tax Ordinance (Amendment) 2025 but also called for the formation of a national alliance of chambers under the Inter-Chambers Harmony Committee to amplify their collective voice and demand urgent pro-business reforms from the government.</p>\n<p>The meeting was held during the visit of RCCI delegation to KCCI aiming to strengthen ties and chart a unified path forward.</p>\n<p>Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala, who joined the meeting via Zoom, emphasised that fragmentation among chambers has historically undermined their influence.</p>\n<p>\"We must raise a unified voice and work collectively to address the widespread challenges the business community is facing\", he stressed.

After the successful upgradation of the refineries, all local refineries will be supplying Euro V fuels.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that a significant portion of Pakistan's transport and agricultural sectors does not require Euro V diesel, making locally produced grades both suitable and efficient for market needs.</p>\n<p>Smuggled and substandard fuel entering the market is also a significant threat to product quality and market stability. Continued reliance on local refineries enhances energy resilience, curbs foreign exchange losses, and ensures a stable fuel supply for the country.</p>\n<p>The multibillion-dollar plant upgrade projects by Pakistan's refineries are at stake as the government has yet to resolve the issue of sales tax exemption on supplies of petroleum products.</p>\n"

On the issue of taxation, LCCI official the alignment of FBR's SME definition with SMEDA's, recommending that enterprises with an annual turnover of up to Rs800 million be classified as SMEs, instead of the current Rs250 million limit.</p>\n<p>The proposed that the cascading principle should also be applied to sales tax, with 0% on raw materials, 5-8% on intermediate goods and 18% on finished products.</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>Pakistan and India laid out contrasting yet complementary visions at the 58th Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Milan, on Monday, with India focusing on digital transformation and long-term development, and Pakistan calling for stronger support to sustain its economic recovery amid structural reforms.</p>\n<p>India emphasised its roadmap to becoming a developed nation by 2047, under the “Vikasit Bharat” mission led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Indian delegation lauded the ADB president’s client-centric, agile approach and welcomed the bank’s capital adequacy reforms and new targets under ADB’s Strategy 2030. Notably, India highlighted its progress in bridging the digital divide through initiatives like Digital India, which their finance minister said reshaped education, healthcare, governance, and financial services.</p>\n<p>“It’s an old adage that time is money. It holds relevance even today. Process reforms for reduction in processing time, both for sovereign and non-sovereign operations, shall benefit the developing member countries significantly,” suggested Indian Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan, whose finance minister was absent, underscored the need for greater aid effectiveness and a merit-based, transparent approach to development financing. The country warned that despite a macroeconomic turnaround driven by International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and ADB-backed reforms, it remains vulnerable to debt burdens, climate shocks, and limited fiscal space.</p>\n<p>“Fragile economies continue to grapple with daunting levels of debt servicing, shrinking trade possibilities, costly climate events and persistent poverty levels. Pakistan is no exception to these challenges,” said Dr Kazim Niaz, Secretary for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Pakistan’s temporary-Governor for ADB.</p>\n<p>“Resource availability is shrinking due to competing priorities. We strongly advocate renewed focus on synergies and institutional integrity in aid delivery,” he said.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging ADB as a trusted partner, Pakistan urged the bank to increase both financial and technical assistance, especially in finalising a long-term Country Partnership Framework tailored to national and sub-national development needs. Pakistan also pushed for greater private sector engagement and policy-based lending, alongside structured collaboration among multilateral partners like the World Bank.</p>\n<p>Voicing a similar call from many other countries including the United States and United Kingdom, Niaz said, “We expect ADB to step up its efforts to promote private sector activities and enhancing the footprint of private sector operations.”</p>\n<p><strong>US-China standoff</strong></p>\n<p>Tensions also flared as the United States and China exchanged pointed remarks over the institution’s priorities and lending policies.</p>\n<p>The US representative, in a sharp address, welcomed the ADB President Masato Kanda but warned that the bank was straying from its core mission. The US urged the ADB to refocus on poverty reduction and private sector-led, job-rich growth, and to stop what it termed “coercive and opaque lending” practices by other creditors.</p>\n<p>Calling for greater efficiency, the US demanded a firmer implementation of the bank’s graduation policy, explicitly naming the People’s Republic of China. “Concrete steps must be taken to put China on a clear path to graduation,” the US governor declared, arguing that higher-income countries with access to global financing no longer require ADB loans.</p>\n<p>This mimics a call made just weeks ago by the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had also urged the ADB president to take concrete steps towards ending loans to China and financing civilian nuclear energy.</p>\n<p>In a strong rebuttal, China’s representative slammed the US position, calling it “unacceptable” and contrary to ADB rules. China insisted that it remains the world’s largest developing country and has not met the criteria for graduation under ADB’s own assessments.</p>\n<p>“China is not just a borrower but also a major contributor,” the Chinese official said, highlighting the country’s 30% share in recent global growth. Beijing urged the ADB to uphold multilateralism, resist politicisation, and continue financing climate goals and technological innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>ADB appoints new chair</strong></p>\n<p>Member countries’ governors approved a sweeping set of recommendations, including key financial reports, budget updates, and the 2027 annual meeting schedule. Uzbekistan was elected Chair of the Board of Governors for 2025–26, with Norway and Thailand named Vice-Chairs.</p>\n<p>Newly appointed ADB President Masato Kanda delivered his first annual address, warning of mounting challenges across Asia—including geopolitical tensions, debt burdens, and economic uncertainty—threatening hard-won development gains. He reaffirmed ADB’s commitment to support vulnerable member countries with expanded financing, crisis-response tools, and policy coordination.</p>\n<p>Kanda announced that recent capital management reforms have boosted the ADB’s lending capacity by $100 billion over the next decade, allowing a 50% scale-up in operations. In 2024, ADB committed $24.3 billion in total assistance, with a 29% surge in private-sector financing and a 47% increase in aid to fragile and conflict-affected states.</p>\n<p>Italy, host and founding member, reiterated the importance of inclusive, private-sector-led growth, AI-driven digital transformation, and harmonised procurement across multilateral banks. It backed stronger cross-border payment systems and welcomed the ADB’s deeper cooperation with the World Bank and national development banks.</p>\n<p>The ADB’s updated Capital Utilisation Plan and focus on non-sovereign operations received broad support, as did a record $5 billion replenishment of the Asia Development Fund and Technical Assistance Special Fund.</p>\n<p>The United States abstained from votes on the annual report and net income allocation but did not block adoption.</p>\n"

Where there was still some increase in distribution losses, the recoveries did improve during July-March period of this fiscal year, showed the official record shared with the ECC.</p>\n<p>The ECC instructed the Power Division to further improve the fiscal position of these companies, as both the losses and recoveries were still in breach of the targets given by the power sector regulator; the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).</p>\n<p>Compared to the estimates of adding Rs390 billion in the power sectors losses during July-March period, the increase was 221 billion, said Sardar Awais Laghari, the Federal Minister for Power while talking to The Express Tribune.</p>\n<p>The Minister added that even compared to the same period of the last fiscal year, the losses were Rs143 billion, or 40% less. This showed that the boards of these distribution companies were on track to achieve their targets, except for Hyderabad and Sukkur, said the Power Minister.</p>\n<p>Last year, the government had replaced the boards of the power distribution companies but did not touch Hyderabad and Sukkur boards due to an understanding reached with the Pakistan Peoples Party.</p>\n<p>The Minister said that after improving recoveries from the private sector, his ministry has now sought the Finance Ministry's help in recovering outstanding dues from federal and provincial governments.</p>\n<p>In December, the federal government had asked all four provincial governments to clear their electricity bills amounting to Rs150 billion to avoid power cuts and financial losses to the national economy. Sindh tops the list with payables totalling Rs59.7 billion as of September last year, followed by Balochistan's Rs39.6 billion and Punjab's Rs38 billion, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has the lowest electricity payables amounting to Rs8.9 billion.</p>\n<p>A Finance Ministry official said that there was a mechanism available to adjust only those dues, which are reconciled and confirmed by the provincial governments. These payments are adjusted against the NFC dues but only when these are confirmed by the provinces, he added.</p>\n<p>According to the information shared with the ECC, compared to 15.14% losses during the first nine months of the last year, the figure slightly jumped to 15.7% this March. The reason behind the increase was the poor performance of Quetta, Sukkur, Hyderabad, Gujranwala and Lahore. The Faisalabad, Islamabad, Multan, Peshawar and Tribal districts companies reduced their losses compared to the last year. The bills' recoveries improved from 92% to 93.8% this March because of better performance of all companies except tribal districts, Hyderabad and Sukkur firms.</p>\n<p>The Power Minister said that the circular debt was also almost stagnant due to the better performance. He said that compared to the estimates of adding Rs411 billion in the flow of the circular debt, there were only Rs2 billion additions during the first nine months of this fiscal year. The total circular debt stood a little under Rs2.4 trillion.</p>\n<p>Among other decisions, the ECC took up a summary submitted by the Petroleum Division for extension in the validity period of sovereign guarantees issued against running finance facilities of Rs50 billion obtained from banks for LNG payments by the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). The Committee discussed the matter and approved extension up to June 2026 of the said sovereign guarantees, on the basis of improved cash flows of the company, according to the Finance Ministry.</p>\n<p>The ECC also considered a summary by the Power Division regarding the solarisation of 27,000 agriculture tube-wells in Balochistan, as decided by the Prime Minister on 2nd July 2024, at an estimated cost of Rs55 billion. The 70% subsidy has to be borne by the federal government. The ECC was told that an amount of Rs14 billion has already been released by the federal government while the remaining Rs24.5 billion was approved on Monday.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the ECC further instructed the Power Division to closely monitor implementation of key components of the project, particularly the disconnection of tube-wells from the grid and removal of transformers and fixtures for every batch of feeders, as agreed under the project. The ECC also directed the Power Division to report back the progress on this account to ECC, in July.</p>\n"

Bush’s administration has made explosive claims that the US government secretly built a massive network of underground “cities” to shelter the wealthy and powerful in the event of a catastrophic global crisis.</p>\n<p>Catherine Austin Fitts, who served as assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development from 1989 to 1990, made the allegations in a recent interview on <em>The Tucker Carlson Podcast</em>, claiming the underground system was funded through more than $21 trillion in unauthorised government spending.</p>\n\n<p>Though her claims are unverified, Fitts pointed to research by economist Mark Skidmore of Michigan State University, who in 2017 reported uncovering trillions in unsupported budget adjustments within the Departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development between 1998 and 2015.</p>\n<p>One figure included a staggering $6.5 trillion in adjustments made by the US Army in a single fiscal year.</p>\n<p>“I started looking at where the money went and found evidence pointing to the construction of underground bases, city infrastructure, and hidden transportation systems,” Fitts said. “We estimate there could be around 170 such facilities, some even beneath the ocean.”</p>\n<p>Fitts alleged the facilities were intended as secure locations for elite shelter in case of a “near-extinction event” but could also support covert government operations, including what she described as a possible “secret space program.”</p>\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfYqwT-1FX5ej4GKamLm0xpTYBeFue8awrmhzWgyAJj5saIh1lVINmDSveVe04jebSsinTZjGikqkB1Axta2noY5MJxZ3aPxNQHYAWvjS_FH1Rk51dNHVXER_RCNcwJhl7lsoALfA?key=1QlyrVTj_8rE5Dkx6enEY6be\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Tucker Carlson, responding to the claims, added that he had once spoken with a contractor who claimed a transformer box near Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C., was actually an emergency exit linked to a hidden government tunnel system.</p>\n<p>Fitts also suggested these facilities operate on advanced “breakthrough energy” technologies, asserting, “I’m convinced this energy exists. Some of the ships flying around the planet aren’t using classical electricity.”</p>\n<p>While her statements remain uncorroborated, they come at a time of rising interest in luxury survival infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In early 2025, Virginia-based firm SAFE (Strategically Armored &amp; Fortified Environments) announced plans to build a $300 million private doomsday bunker named <em>Aerie</em>, offering AI-driven medical care and “wellness” features.</p>\n<p>Memberships start at $20 million, and the company says it aims to construct similar bunkers in all 50 states.</p>\n<p>SAFE’s founder called Virginia “ground zero for the finest demographic in the world” — fuelling further speculation that elite shelter projects may not be just science fiction.</p>\n<p>Whether fact or fantasy, Fitts’ claims have reignited debate over government secrecy, defence budgets, and what lengths those in power might go to when preparing for the worst.</p>\n"

Friendship,” Trump initially responded.</p>\n<p>When pressed further, he elaborated: “Regardless of anything, we’re going to be friends with Canada...

Oshie, a noted Trump supporter, has not played this NHL season.</p>\n<p>Carney, a former central banker, appeared unfazed by the hockey tangent, maintaining his diplomatic tone throughout the event.</p>\n<p>While the meeting aimed to cool rising tensions over trade and sovereignty rhetoric—including Trump’s suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state—it ended on an oddly light-hearted note, with puck talk stealing the spotlight.</p>\n"

It was a bit not easy for me to accept it because I know what really happened,\" said Sinner.</p>\n<p>\"But sometimes you have to choose the best in a very bad moment. And that's what we did.

It was the greatest moment. I had that win on, we can Indian home ground because most of the crowd was Indian.</p>\n<p>\"At first there were 25 competitors, then after elimination four were left towards the end, and I was declared a winner. There was such a roar in the hall and chants for Pakistan, it was an incredible moment.\"</p>\n<p>He also bagged a bronze medal in the lightweight natural bodybuilding category.</p>\n<p>Furqan began his bodybuilding journey after a long break at the behest of his wife who had joined Mr Universe/ Mr World Rameez Ibrahim Khan's gym.</p>\n<p>\"My wife used to train with Rameez's sister and my wife encouraged me to return to sports. I used to train in the gym when I was a teenager, and when I was in Matric in 1998-99 I used to play cricket as well. Still, I got busy with studies, and then got busy building my own business, I have been very successful at it. And then I returned to the sport. I have also run the Karachi Marathon.</p>\n<p>\"But this experience has been great and I train at Rameez's gym. The last few months before the GPBI we trained continuously and the hardest part has been the discipline and diet. You cannot eat anything else but boiled chicken, boiled eggs, steamed fish, and have some black coffee. But it all paid off beautifully in the end.\"</p>\n<p>Now celebrating the win with his family, friends, and colleagues, Furqan adds it has been a very empowering journey and the response only highlights the need for the youth to be more active and partake in sports, be it going to the gym regularly, running, swimming, etc.\"</p>\n<p>After the success with GPBI, Furqan is now targeting another international amateur event in Thailand and aims to beat Europeans who are bigger and better on stage.</p>\n<p>But when asked how was his experience with Indian athletes in Dubai, amidst the war horns blowing on both sides of the border, Furqan's reply was heartwarming.</p>\n<p>\"I dedicate my medals to the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan. I am not worried about the war like that, but as people, as athletes, we were having dinner with the Indians, and we were exchanging our stories about migration at the time of Independence too, many had roots in Pakistan, and migrated to India, and so on and so forth, so among ourselves there was no animosity or bitterness.</p>\n<p>\"I shook hands and celebrated with the Indian competitor who was on the stage and at the podium with me.\"</p>\n<p>Furqan added that there is a trend that more women are coming to the gym now and he is pleased to see the increase in awareness about fitness in the last few years.</p>\n<p>Along with Furqan, there were three other Pakistani participants at the championships.</p>\n<p>Jawwad Ahmed won three gold medals in the Senior bodybuilding event, Masters 40+, and overall title winner at the Dubai Amateur World championship.</p>\n<p>Anjum Warsi bagged three gold medals in the senior open powerlifting event, squat, bench press, and deadlift. He got two more gold medals in the powerlifting masters event and a silver.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sumair Ahmed became the champion in junior physique and junior bodybuilding events.</p>\n<p>Rameez was also the head judge and the man behind GPBI Pakistan.</p>\n"

It is a sad news for Liverpool fans around the world, but at the same time Madrid fans aka 'Madaristas' are over the moon to welcome their new right-back.</p>\n<p>Alexander-Arnold has been on Madrid radar for a couple of years and is considered one of the key members of new Galacticos era to take the club forward.</p>\n<p>The 26-year-old will join Los Blancos on a free transfer upon the expiry of his contract in June 2025. This move marks a significant shift in his career, as he seeks new challenges and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Despite all the efforts from the Reds to retain him, including offering a reportedly record-breaking deal for a full-back, the England international opted to take the new challenge.</p>\n<p>It is reported that he had made the decision to leave Liverpool in March, but delayed the announcement to avoid distracting from Liverpool's Premier League title campaign. In an emotional statement, he expressed gratitude to the club, teammates, and fans, emphasizing his desire to grow beyond his comfort zone.</p>\n<p>His move to Real Madrid signifies a fresh chapter in his already illustrious career, which includes a Champions League trophy, Premier League Champions and more.</p>\n<p>The right-back is set to sign a five-year deal with the Spanish giants reportedly worth £7.5 million annually after tax. His arrival adds to a growing English contingent at the Santiago Bernabéu, joining the likes of Jude Bellingham, Michael Owen, David Beckham and Steve McManaman.</p>\n<p>His technical prowess and leadership qualities are expected to complement Madrid's tactical setup, enhancing their defensive and offensive dynamics.</p>\n<p>Alexander-Arnold's ability to snuck up key long passes combined with his speed will be a treat to watch. Moreover, his on-field chemistry with England team-mate Bellingham, linking up with front trio featuring Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo would be mesmerising.</p>\n<p>A Storied Career</p>\n<p>His journey as the Reds began just at the age of six, progressing through the youth ranks to become a first-team regular. Over the years, he has amassed 352 appearances, where he scored 23 goals and provided 92 assists and bagged two Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two League Cups, a Champions League title, and a Club World Cup. His exceptional crossing ability, tactical intelligence, and versatility have redefined the role of a modern full-back.</p>\n<p>Liverpool now faces the challenge of filling the void left by Alexander-Arnold's departure. While the club has expressed interest in potential replacements, the transition may take time as they seek a suitable successor to maintain the team's competitive edge.</p>\n"

With a clean slate ahead, the selectors and team management have the opportunity to rebuildbut not without facing tough questions.</p>\n<p>Chief among them is the form and long-term role of veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, both of whom have come under increasing scrutiny for their performances in the longest format.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the leadership structure within the Test team may be due for an overhaul.</p>\n<p>While Rohit Sharma is expected to retain the captaincy, reports suggest that his deputy, Jasprit Bumrah, could be removed from the role due to his recurring injuries and the demands of workload management.</p>\n<p>In his place, Shubman Gillcurrently vice-captain in ODIs and T20Isis viewed as a strong contender to take over the leadership mantle in the near future. Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant is also being considered for a future leadership role.</p>\n<p>The leadership discussion intensified during India's last Test series in Australia. Rohit missed the opening Test in Perth due to personal reasons, with Bumrah leading the team to a memorable victory.</p>\n<p>Rohit returned for the next three matches but opted out of the final Test in Sydney, citing poor form. Bumrah stepped in again but suffered a back injury, ruling him out of action for nearly three months.</p>\n<p>According to media reports, a senior player expressed interest in returning as captain for the England tour, but the team management rejected the proposal, stressing the importance of consistency and long-term planning.</p>\n<p>\"A new WTC cycle is starting. The future and continuity have to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series. The last two Test series haven't been ideal for the team, and the England series is very crucial,\" a source claimed.</p>\n<p>Following the opener in Leeds, the rest of the Test matches are scheduled to be held at Edgbaston, Lord's, Old Trafford, and The Oval.</p>\n"

Welch, who initially gained fame from a viral interview in which she shared an intimate anecdote, promoted the $HAWK coin, which quickly surged to a $490 million market cap before crashing. The coin's collapse prompted a lawsuit from investors, alleging that they were misled, and Welch has since cooperated with the legal team involved.</p>\n<p>“It really hurt my feelings when it turned out the way it did,” Welch said, expressing regret over the loss experienced by her fans, some of whom had trusted her endorsement of the coin. She admitted that she didn’t fully understand the mechanics of the cryptocurrency world and felt sorrow for those who lost money due to the investment. \"I feel sorry for everybody that just lost money,\" she added.</p>\n<p>Following the incident, Welch chose to step back from public life for a period, taking a much-needed mental health break. During this time, she refrained from releasing episodes of her podcast <em>Talk Tuah</em>, which she had launched in the wake of her viral fame. She acknowledged the pressure that came with the scandal and the strain it placed on her well-being, adding that she struggled with mental health even before her rise to internet stardom.</p>\n<p>As she returns to the podcasting world, Welch says she is more cautious about who she partners with, ensuring greater scrutiny for future collaborations. She also emphasized that she hopes to make her podcast more authentic to herself, making it more \"girlier\" and in line with her evolving vision.</p>\n<p>Welch’s transparency about the situation reflects her efforts to regain trust and continue her career with greater awareness.</p>\n"

        "content": "\n<p>More than 70 former Eurovision contestants have signed an open letter calling for Israel and its national broadcaster, Kan, to be banned from the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest.</p>\n<p>The letter, addressed to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), condemns Israel’s actions in Gaza and demands the same treatment for Israel as was given to Russia in 2022, when it was expelled from the competition.</p>\n<p>Among the signatories are British musician Mae Muller, Irish Eurovision winner Charlie McGettigan, and Portuguese singer Fernando Tordo. The letter accuses Israel of committing \"genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza\" and maintaining a \"decades-long regime of apartheid and military occupation\" against the Palestinian people. It also references the ongoing war in Gaza, where over 50,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>\n<p>The letter also highlights the controversy surrounding last year’s Eurovision, where Israel’s Eden Golan participated amidst the backdrop of Israel's air strikes on Gaza. Golan’s performance in the 2024 competition finished in fifth place, despite widespread protests and a petition signed by over 56,000 people calling for Israel’s exclusion.</p>\n<p>For the 2025 edition, Israeli entrant Yuval Raphael is set to perform \"New Day Will Rise\" in the final in Basel, Switzerland, on May 17. However, the letter’s signatories argue that Israel's participation is a direct contradiction to the EBU’s decision to ban Russia from the contest due to its invasion of Ukraine. The musicians claim that there should not be a \"double standard\" when it comes to Israel’s actions, with 2010 Malta contestant Thea Garrett saying, “You bomb, you’re out.”</p>\n<p>The EBU has yet to respond to the letter, and the situation is already stirring debate within the music and entertainment industries. The letter calls on the EBU to act swiftly, warning that failing to do so would risk further tarnishing the festival's credibility.</p>\n<p>The call for Israel’s exclusion from Eurovision comes amidst broader boycotts, with artists such as Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead and Israeli musician Dudu Tassa canceling performances due to pro-Palestinian protests.</p>\n"

One user scoffed, “Sydney Sweeney referencing Kim Novak, a white lady, for Superfine: Tailoring Black Style….ok?” while another fired off, “Paying homage to a white lady when the theme is tailoring black style.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image1746536974-1/image1746536974-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The actress is set to portray Novak in the upcoming biopic <em>Scandalous!</em>, directed by Met Gala co-chair Colman Domingo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/reawakening-fashion-metropolitan-museum-art-103898579.jpg?w=1024\"/></p>\n<p>The film will explore Novak’s controversial love affair with Sammy Davis Jr., a Black entertainer and cultural icon, during the racially tense 1950s.</p>\n<p>That context, however, didn’t shield Sweeney from criticism.</p>\n<p>More social media critiques piled on:<br/>\n“Sydney Sweeney is not on the theme for the night at all. Nice gown, beautiful gowns, though.”<br/>\n“Actress Sydney Sweeney looks like she’s going to a White House Correspondents Dinner and not the Met Gala based on Super Fine: Tailoring Black Style. #MetGala2025”<br/>\n“I guess this is the ‘safe’ way to interpret the theme! Smh!”<br/>\n“Sydney Sweeney needs to explain how paying homage to a white woman is black dandyism.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image-11746536974-0/image-11746536974-0.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Despite the outrage, Sweeney stood by her vision, offering a brief explanation during her Vogue red carpet interview with correspondent Lala Anthony.</p>\n<p>“I always feel that [Miu Miu] just brings such beautiful stories to every dress,” she said. “So this is actually paying homage to Kim Novak, and I’m doing a movie with Colman Domingo … so we wanted to really just bring that to life.”</p>\n<p>Though she looked every bit the Hollywood siren, the dissonance between her glamorous execution and the cultural weight of the Met Gala’s theme left many questioning the message behind the sparkle. In an evening centered on honoring Black style, her homage to a white screen legend was a bold and for some, baffling choice.</p>\n"

Sawai’s trousers were wide-legged, while Zendaya’s flared at the hem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://people.com/thmb/wNkoVyzFFU3GI-MdYea_SiBXJFY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x115:747x117)/zendaya-anna-sawai-met-gala-050525-5445e5d22d5c425c9d4a0a7775e86ca1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The <em>Shōgun</em> star’s entrance firmly placed her among the evening’s most memorable debuts.</p>\n<p>Zendaya’s appearance marks her seventh time attending the Met Gala, all of which she’s graced solo. Her Met Gala journey began in 2015 with a sculptural Fausto Puglisi gown embroidered with sun motifs, in line with the <em>China: Through The Looking Glass</em> theme.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>She made annual appearances through the end of the 2010s, famously embodying a light-up Cinderella in 2019 for the <em>Camp: Notes on Fashion</em> theme—a tribute to her Disney beginnings.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sawai is new to the Met Gala scene but certainly not to fashion’s radar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2025/5/6/e8fd7827/new-york-new-york.jpg?w=400&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;dpr=2&amp;fp-x=0.5385&amp;fp-y=0.2518\"/></p>\n<p>Her debut couldn’t have been more fitting, given the evening’s homage to Black style and dandyism, rooted in historical expression and modern tailoring.</p>\n<p>Announced by <em>Vogue</em> back in October 2024, the co-chairs for this year’s gala included Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, and Anna Wintour, with LeBron James serving as honorary chair.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Met-Gala-Co-Chairs-2025.jpg?w=800\"/></p>\n<p>The evening also featured a high-profile host committee including Simone Biles and her husband Jonathan Owens, Doechii, Regina King, Spike Lee, Usher, and Angel Reese.</p>\n<p>The event raised funds for the Costume Institute while spotlighting its spring 2025 exhibit, <em>Superfine: Tailoring Black Style</em>.</p>\n<p>The exhibition draws from guest curator Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book <em>Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity</em>, with Andrew Bolton, Curator in Charge, explaining that it explores “the Black dandy as both a concept and an identity signifier.”</p>\n<p>This year’s dress code, <em>Tailored for You</em>, emphasized the artistry of menswear and suiting, and few embodied that message better than Zendaya and Sawai.</p>\n"
