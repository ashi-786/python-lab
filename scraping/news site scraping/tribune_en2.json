These are longstanding issues over the past 76 years and must be addressed. Pakistan is the biggest victim of terrorism. This is a golden chance for both countries to resolve the issue of terrorism. On Kashmir, this is a historic opportunity. Trump has raised the Kashmir issue, which marks another breakthrough. He has said that Kashmir must also be included in discussions.”</p>\n<p>Khawaja Asif emphasised that almost all wars between India and Pakistan have been over Kashmir.</p>\n<p>“The conflict from two days ago was also because of Kashmir. Modi tried to push the region into a living hell, but by Allah’s grace we were saved. Our armed forces stood like an iron wall. These issues must now be settled,” he said.</p>\n<p>The defence minister called it a cruel irony that the country which has suffered the most from terrorism is being blamed and attacked for it.</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>On the water dispute, he said the issue had already been settled under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which cannot be suspended.</p>\n<p>Asif added, “The way we responded is evidence of our preparation. The strong response we gave has left them licking their wounds. Modi is being criticised in the Indian parliament, their media and military briefings reflect their pain. This is also a diplomatic win for us. Apart from Israel, no one stands with India. If India tries again, the whole world will stand with Pakistan. Pakistan has demonstrated restraint and military strength. In our 76-year history, our forces have not achieved such a major victory as they did this time.”</p>\n<p><strong>Pakistan-India ceasefire</strong></p>\n<p>Pakistan and India agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire on Saturday following days of intense military exchanges that raised fears of a full-scale conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>\n<p>The announcement was first made by US President Donald Trump and later confirmed by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The ceasefire came after missile strikes, drone incursions, and retaliatory operations across the border.</p>\n<p>Tensions flared after a deadly April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), that left 26 civilians dead. India blamed Pakistan-based elements without providing evidence; Islamabad rejected the claim.</p>\n<p>India responded by closing the Wagah border, revoking Pakistani visas, and suspending the Indus Waters Treaty—moves Pakistan labelled as an “act of war.”</p>\n<p>By May 6–7, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, claiming to have downed five Indian jets, including Rafales, and intercepted 77 Israeli-origin Harop drones.</p>\n<p>The US played a central role in facilitating backchannel diplomacy. Secretary Rubio and Vice President JD Vance held talks with senior leaders from both countries, including PMs Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, as well as top defence and intelligence officials.</p>\n<p>Following Trump’s announcement, both countries suspended military activity across land, air, and sea, though allegations of ceasefire breach were also reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).</p>\n</span>"

OpenAI has urged the US government to establish a formal policy framework that supports broader fair use rights for AI development.</p>\n<p>Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI and now leads rival startup xAI (which is merging with the platform formerly known as Twitter), recently backed Jack Dorsey’s controversial proposal to eliminate all intellectual property laws.</p>\n</span>"

    "story_text": "<span class=\"story-text\">\n<p>If Twilight ignited your love for supernatural romance, you’re not alone.</p>\n<p>But the vampire romance genre stretches far beyond Edward and Bella.</p>\n<p>From twisted bloodlust to poetic love stories, these ten vampire films take the passion, danger, and drama of the undead to thrilling new levels. Whether you’re craving something steamy, philosophical, or emotionally raw, here’s your must-watch list.</p>\n<h2>1. Thirst (2009)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Thirst - Cinéma Moderne\" src=\"https://www.cinemamoderne.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/thirst-still-siteweb_800x450-730x411.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Like Edward Cullen, Sang-hyun (played by Song Kang-ho) wrestles with guilt over his bloodlust, though his battle is far more brutal. Directed by Park Chan-wook, Thirst follows a priest who becomes a vampire after a botched medical experiment. The film dives deep into moral torment and forbidden desire.</p>\n<h2>2. The Wisdom of Crocodiles (1998)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"The Wisdom of Crocodiles Review | Movie - Empire\" src=\"https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/empire-tmdb/films/1448/images/tfmlcjPsVVrrbkTCKOPNgB2q13r.jpg?ar=16%3A9&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=top&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1440&amp;q=80\"/></p>\n<p>Also known as Immortality, this eerie drama stars Jude Law as a suave vampire named Steven who seduces women to feed on their love — and blood. But he yearns for one woman whose genuine love might finally make him whole. It's a seductive and haunting tale.</p>\n<h2>3. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night review – exhilarating vampire girl power |  Movies | The Guardian\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432139609456/a-girl-walks-home-alone-a-009.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=69751a0b05c85b6f8d3050990a8a5e4b\"/></p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>Set in a ghost town called Bad City, this Iranian black-and-white film blends horror and romance in an unforgettable way. The unnamed vampire (Sheila Vand) stalks the streets at night, preying on abusive men, but her budding bond with a lonely outcast gives the film a surprising tenderness.</p>\n<h2>4. Dracula (1979)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"DRACULA (1979): Film Review - THE HORROR ENTERTAINMENT MAGAZINE\" src=\"https://www.screamhorrormag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/D1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Frank Langella brings a romantic edge to Count Dracula in this adaptation, having just portrayed the vampire on Broadway the year before. While the plot stays close to Bram Stoker's novel, the film leans into romance, turning Dracula into a seductive and complex figure.</p>\n<h2>5. Interview With the Vampire (1994)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Interview With the Vampire' at 30: Neil Jordan On Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt\" src=\"https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MSDINWI_EC031-e1731111043894.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>This gothic classic features Brad Pitt as Louis, a vampire recounting his long life in a present-day interview. Though the 2022 TV version leaned harder into its romantic and queer subtext, the '90s film still delivers powerful emotional depth and lavish vampire storytelling.</p>\n<h2>6. Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"In defense of Coppola's polarizing take on &quot;Dracula&quot; | The Spool\" src=\"https://thespool.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dracula1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Gary Oldman gives a raw, emotional performance as Dracula in this visually rich, faithful adaptation. While it honors Stoker's original novel, the film adds a romantic angle and paints Dracula as a deeply wounded lover, offering a tragic but beautiful perspective.</p>\n<h2>7. Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (2023)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person • New Zealand  International Film Festival\" src=\"https://www.nziff.co.nz/assets/resized/sm/upload/71/zb/bc/lg/HERO_Humanist%20Vampire%20Seeking%20Consenting%20Suicidal%20Person_2-2000-2000-1125-1125-crop-fill.jpg?k=98ac6d75a2\"/></p>\n<p>This offbeat gem follows Sasha (Sara Montpetit), a gentle vampire who can't bring herself to kill. Pressured by her family to act like a “real” vampire, she finds a solution in Paul (Félix-Antoine Bénard), a depressed teen willing to give up his life. The result is weird, funny, and heartfelt.</p>\n<h2>8. The Hunger (1983)</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"The Hunger (1983) - IMDb\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MjA2MzkwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM1OTkwNzE@._V1_.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon star in this stylized, erotic horror. A twisted love triangle forms when John (Bowie), turned immortal by Miriam (Deneuve), begins to age rapidly. When Sarah (Sarandon) enters the picture, desire and survival collide.</p>\n</span>"

Jaishankar, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The ceasefire came after missile strikes, drone incursions, and retaliatory operations across the border.</p>\n<p>Tensions flared after a deadly April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), that left 26 civilians dead. India blamed Pakistan-based elements without providing evidence; Islamabad rejected the claim.</p>\n<p>India responded by closing the Wagah border, revoking Pakistani visas, and suspending the Indus Waters Treaty—moves Pakistan labelled as an “act of war.”</p>\n<p>By May 6–7, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, claiming to have downed five Indian jets, including Rafales, and intercepted 77 Israeli-origin Harop drones.</p>\n<p>The US played a central role in facilitating backchannel diplomacy. Secretary Rubio and Vice President JD Vance held talks with senior leaders from both countries, including PMs Shehbaz Sharif and Narendra Modi, as well as top defence and intelligence officials.</p>\n<p>Following Trump’s announcement, both countries suspended military activity across land, air, and sea, though allegations of ceasefire breach were also reported from both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).</p>\n</span>"

The answer lies in the timeline.</p>\n<p>The sequence is not a dream, but a flashback to a time well before Joel’s death at the hands of Abby.</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>It likely takes place around Ellie’s 16th birthday.</p>\n<p>In the game, there’s a chapter called “The Birthday Gift,” where Joel takes Ellie on a surprise trip to a museum filled with dinosaur exhibits and space artifacts.</p>\n<p>Footage from season 2 trailers already confirmed that this beautiful chapter will be adapted, and this scene hints at its lead-in.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Joel takes Ellie to an aerospace museum in The Last of Us season 2\" src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/joel-takes-ellie-to-an-aerospace-museum-in-the-last-of-us-season-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Another key detail is that Ellie is still living in Joel’s house during the flashback.</p>\n<p>In the present timeline, she’s moved into the garage after their falling-out.</p>\n<p>This placement makes it clear: the moment occurs before Ellie discovers Joel lied about what happened with the Fireflies, before the emotional fracture in their relationship.</p>\n<p>The emotional weight of this flashback contrasts sharply with the violence Ellie inflicts on Nora, reinforcing the story’s core themes of love, loss, and vengeance.</p>\n<p>Though Joel’s return is brief and out of sequence, it’s a powerful reminder of the bond Ellie is still trying to process, and sets the stage for more devastating emotional beats in the episodes ahead.</p>\n</span>"

Certain sector-specific tariffs, including those related to fentanyl, will remain in place.</p>\n<p>Bessent described the talks as \"productive and constructive,\" emphasising the mutual interest in achieving balanced trade and avoiding economic decoupling. The agreement includes the establishment of a new trade consultation mechanism aimed at preventing future escalations.</p>\n<p>Previously, Washington <a href=\"https://tribune.com.pk/story/2545354/us-claims-progress-in-trade-talks-with-china\" rel=\"nofollow\">expressed</a> optimism at the end of a weekend of trade talks with China aimed to de-escalate trade tensions sparked by President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff rollout.</p>\n<p>\"I'm happy to report that we've made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva.</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>\"The talks were productive,\" he said, taking no questions from the media, but promising a \"complete briefing\" on the outcome of the talks on Monday.</p>\n<p>Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who also took part in the two days of closed-door talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, said that the differences between the sides were \"not so large as maybe thought\".</p>\n<p>After the first day of negotiations, Trump had posted on Truth Social that the discussions had been \"very good\", describing them as \"a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\". Beijing had yet to comment Sunday, but on Saturday Chinese state news agency Xinhua described the talks as \"an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue\".</p>\n<p>The Chinese delegation was expected to speak to the media Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>The meetings marked the first time senior officials from the world's two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking a robust retaliation from Beijing.</p>\n<p>\"The talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,\", Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told AFP. He called the tariffs a \"lose-lose proposition\".</p>\n<p>The tariffs imposed by Trump on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145 percent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245 percent.</p>\n<p>In retaliation, China put 125-percent tariffs on US goods. Ahead of the meeting at the discrete villa residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an \"80% Tariff on China seems right!\"</p>\n<p>However, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally. China would also need to make concessions, she said.</p>\n</span>"

The conflict, which lasted several hours, included personal accusations, emotional exchanges, and a police response.</strong></p>\n<p>The dispute began with Nick confronting Amouranth over a past incident, questioning her about her interactions with others and suggesting dishonesty about the nature of their relationship. In response, Amouranth denied the claims and accused Nick of misrepresenting events. She also referenced being pressured into situations she was uncomfortable with in the past.</p>\n<p>At one point, financial matters became part of the exchange. Nick claimed that Amouranth earns around $1.5 million per month across platforms and mentioned that in 2022 and 2023, monthly revenue reached $2 million without streaming incentives. He compared recent income to previous years, noting a decline under current contracts.</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<div data-oembed-url=\"https://x.com/kick_clips/status/1921755553279217774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1921755553279217774%7Ctwgr%5E98f46f6cf93cb67b8703cd2d071b7ecdc7e33cb8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportskeeda.com%2Fus%2Fstreamers%2Famouranth-s-viral-conflict-husband-explained\">\n<blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Amouranth’s husband claims they made $2M a month on OnlyFans in 2022–2023, and now he’s upset she’s “only” making $1.2M a month from OF and Kick<a href=\"https://t.co/GiIUtKkCWl\" rel=\"nofollow\">pic.twitter.com/GiIUtKkCWl</a></p>\n— Kick Clips 🎬 (@kick_clips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kick_clips/status/1921755553279217774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow\">May 12, 2025</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>\n</div>\n<p>Tensions escalated further when Nick raised concerns about being recorded.

And in a time where war is not just waged on borders but on the black mirrors that run our lives, reading political fiction becomes less pastime, more an act of resistance. </p>\n<p>Books that expose media power, herd mentality, and the quiet suffocation of dissent feel urgently alive amid India’s current war-mongering, where image eclipses reality and emotion trumps truth. These four novels remind us that control often begins not with remotely manoeuvred war machinery, but with what we are told to forget, who we are taught to fear, and the truths we’re told to stop questioning.</p>\n<p><strong>‘The Memory Police’</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/sidebar-41747042097-0/sidebar-41747042097-0.png\" style=\"height:undefinedpx; width:undefinedpx\"/></p>\n<p>Set on an unnamed island where objects, and eventually memories, disappear by authoritarian decree, <em>The Memory Police</em> by Yōko Ogawa captures the chilling ease with which societies accept erasure. Ogawa’s prose is spare, haunting. People forget perfume, then birds, then novels. The horror lies not in what vanishes but in how unbothered the public becomes. The novel is a meditation on complicity, media silence, and the serenity of mass forgetfulness. If you’ve felt the numbness of watching public memory be scrubbed clean, this book will rattle you awake.</p>\n<p><strong>‘The Power’</strong></p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/sidebar-11747032665-0/sidebar-11747032665-0.png\" style=\"height:undefinedpx; width:undefinedpx\"/></p>\n<p>What happens when power changes hands, but not its structure? <em>The Power</em> by Naomi Alderman imagines a world where women develop the ability to emit deadly shocks. The balance shifts overnight, but the systems of dominance remain. Alderman dissects how power corrupts, regardless of who holds it. Through news clippings, oral histories, and a fictional framing device, she mimics the fractured lens of media: unreliable, constructed, always spinning. It’s a sharp, cinematic punch that asks: if we could remake the world, would we rebuild the same machinery?</p>\n<p><strong>‘Darkness at Noon’</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/sidebar-21747042066-0/sidebar-21747042066-0.png\" style=\"height:undefinedpx; width:undefinedpx\"/></p>\n<p>The most powerful thing in the world is an idea. This is both good and bad news. Written in 1940 but devastatingly contemporary, Arthur Koestler’s <em>Darkness at Noon</em> explores the psychological violence of ideology. Through the interrogation of Rubashov, a once-loyal revolutionary turned dissenter, we see how totalitarian regimes rewrite logic until betrayal looks like duty. In India’s current socio-political climate, where dissent is branded as sedition, Darkness at Noon feels less like historical fiction, more like a mirror.</p>\n<p><strong>‘Amatka’</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/sidebar-31747042082-0/sidebar-31747042082-0.png\" style=\"height:undefinedpx; width:undefinedpx\"/></p>\n<p>In this surreal Swedish gem by Karin Tidbeck, language holds literal power: stop naming an object, and it dissolves. Bureaucracy is religion, and words are weaponised. Tidbeck’s precise, uncanny prose indicts state propaganda and reminds us of the quiet danger in letting others narrate our reality. Truth, sometimes, is just a few mindful words away.</p>\n<p><em>Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.</em></p>\n</span>"

Pakistan’s fleet includes an estimated 45–50 JF-17 Block IIIs and 20 J-10CEs—approximately 70 aircraft capable of deploying the PL-15E.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The missile's guidance system includes inertial navigation, Beidou satellite updates, a two-way datalink, and AESA radar terminal homing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It features a dual-pulse solid rocket motor and can reach speeds exceeding Mach 5. The warhead, typically high-explosive fragmentation, weighs between 20 to 25 kilograms.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The weapon may have been sourced directly from China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), a claim not independently verified.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">India’s air force, meanwhile, relies on Rafales equipped with Meteor missiles, Su-30MKIs with R-77s, and S-400 SAM systems. PL-15’s range may allow Pakistani fighters to launch from beyond India’s engagement envelopes.</p>\n<p>While Pakistan officially confirmed the use of Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets from Chengdu in the downing of Indian Rafales, it has not specified the munitions used.</p>\n<p>However, fragments of a PL-15 missile were reportedly recovered from a field near Hoshiarpur in India’s Punjab state, potentially marking the first known use of the Chinese missile in active combat.</p>\n<p>The development comes after two US officials told <em>Reuters</em> that a Chinese-made Pakistani fighter aircraft was responsible for shooting down at least two Indian military jets, underscoring a major operational milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter systems.</p>\n<p>A senior French intelligence official also confirmed to CNN that at least one IAF Dassault Rafale jet had been downed during the skirmish with the Pakistan Air Force.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The debris discovery adds pressure to regional air defence planning and underscores shifting dynamics in South Asia’s arms landscape. India’s diversified procurement contrasts with Pakistan’s increasingly centralised reliance on Chinese systems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chinese state media have highlighted the PL-15E’s export readiness and advanced production lines. The system’s presence in an active conflict may provide China with operational feedback and expand its influence in the global arms market. Neither China nor Pakistan has commented on the missile’s appearance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The deployment of the Chinese-made PL-15 missile in South Asia presents a direct technological counter to Western systems like the US AIM-120D AMRAAM and France’s Meteor missile.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Meteor is widely regarded as superior in terms of no-escape zones and sustained propulsion via ramjet, the PL-15’s longer range and advanced AESA guidance give it a strategic edge in first-launch scenarios—particularly when fired from standoff ranges.</p>\n</span>"

S-400 battery system at Udhampur and Bhuj, were also attacked by the proud Pakistan Air Force [PAF],\" Lt Gen Chaudhry told the media.</p>\n<p>\"Military logistic and support sites which helped sustain this unlawful operation against innocent Pakistani civilians like field supply depot at Uri and radar station at Poonch were also targeted,\" he added.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the chief military spokesperson said, military command headquarters, which helped plan the operation of killing of innocent citizens, including 10th and 80th Brigade at KG Top and Nowshera were also destroyed.</p>\n<p>The ISPR director general also said that facilities which harboured and trained proxy elements to perpetrate terrorist attacks inside Pakistan and kill innocent civilians here were specifically identified and destroyed.</p>\n<p>Across the Line of Control (LoC), military elements, including headquarters, logistic bases, artillery positions and posts that had caused civilian casualties in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) through unprovoked artillery and small arms fire were relentlessly targeted and heavily damaged until they raised the white flags and asked for restraint.</p>\n<p>\"Pakistan has brought justice and retribution for reprehensible Indian military's aggression and brutal killings of our citizens. Pakistan's response was a textbook demonstration of integrated tri-services jointness enabled by real-time situational awareness, and network-centric warfare capabilities,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"This synergy across air, land, sea and cyber domains allowed for precision engagements, overwhelming lethality and rapid tempo. All platforms operated in synergy, delivering coordinated effects at carefully selected, decisive points\" he added.</p>\n<p>He said precision-guided long-range Fateh series missiles F-1 and F-2 of the Pakistan Army, precision munitions of the PAF, highly capable long-range loitering killer munitions and precision long-range artillery were used.</p>\n<p>Pakistan Armed Forces, he said, also carried out comprehensive and effective cyber offensive to temporarily cripple and degrade critical infrastructure and services that were being used by Indian forces to sustain their operations, he continued.</p>\n<p>\"Let me tell you that Pakistan Armed Forces possess an adequate suite of very sophisticated niche military technologies. Only some of which were used with restraint in this conflict. Pakistan's military response has been precise, proportionate and still remarkably restrained.\"</p>\n<p>The DG ISPR revealed that Pakistan also sustained an abnormal and immediate spike in Indian-sponsored terrorism across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while \"we were busy in operations\" on the eastern front.</p>\n<p>This spike in terrorism, he said, vindicated that India was directly involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan and its proxies were fully operationalised during this time to distract the attention of the security forces. However, the forces carried out most effective counter-terrorism operations in the western region without any pause,\" he asserted.</p>\n<p>The chief military spokesperson asserted that Pakistan never targeted civilians because \"our religion, culture and professionalism doesn't allow us\" to do so. \"We will never target civilians. Even from Indian statements, did you find that Pakistan attacked anything other than military targets? No.\"</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>He said that Alhamd-o-lillah, Pakistan Armed Forces \"delivered on the promise made to our people\", adding: \"I begin by thanking Almighty Allah for His infinite blessings, mercy, help and divine support as He has ordained the believers to retaliate whenever they are wronged.\"</p>\n<p>He expressed sympathies with families of the Shuhada and prayed for the quick recovery of injured countrymen. He extended heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage and professionalism.</p>\n<p>He also expressed profound appreciation to the brave Pakistani nation, including the youth of Pakistan, who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country. \"Profound thanks are also due to you, the vibrant media of Pakistan who also stood like Bunyanun Marsoos,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"We are extremely grateful to the political leadership of all political parties without any distinction for their unified resolve in support for their armed forces,\" adding that the armed forces were specifically grateful to the inspiring leadership of the prime minister of Pakistan and his cabinet ministers.</p>\n<p>During the war, Chaudhry said that Pakistan's air defence system worked accurately and destroyed all hostile drones that entered its airspace. He shared that around 84 drones were shot down. \"We had promised that anything sent toward us would not go back - and we kept that promise,\" he stated.</p>\n<p>Responding to a question about the ceasefire, Chaudhry said clarified that Pakistan never requested it. \"Put it on record\" that Pakistan \"never requested for a ceasefire,\" he said. \"On the night of May 6 and 7, after those dastardly and cowardly attacks were made, Indians requested and Pakistan gave a very clear response that we will communicate back only after we have given the response that this act deserves.\"</p>\n<p>On May 10, he said, after the \"response and retribution [] and on the request and intervention of international interlocutors, we responded to the already-made request of the Indians,\" he said. \"If you look at public statements from India's Ministry of Defence and armed forces, they were clearly calling for de-escalation,\" he noted.</p>\n<p>Responding to another question, he said, \"In a conflict between two rival nuclear powers  such a conflict is actually an absurdity and it is inconceivable and sheer stupidity. In the case of India and Pakistan, such a conflict can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan, and if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation. This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner,\" the GG ISPR emphasised.</p>\n<p>\"Through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces, we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistani forces employed on the counterterrorism operations  no pull is also exerted on them.\"</p>\n<p>DG ISPR has clarified that Pakistan has no Indian pilot in custody, blaming it to \"social media chatter\". He said: \"This is all part of fake news and propaganda that has been generated from multiple sources.\"</p>\n<p>On the occasion, Air Vice Marshal Ahmed said that the PAF responded boldly and confidently. \"Our action was based on our own timing and choice. The leadership was clear and gave us firm instructions,\" he said.</p>\n<p>He added that the PAF targeted the highest number of Indian Air Force (IAF) airfields in a single mission since 1971. \"We avoided civilian damage and hit with great accuracy,\" he noted. \"Pakistan's swift and effective reply stopped India from creating a new normal through aggressive actions.\"</p>\n<p>He affirmed that Pakistan remained committed to protecting its airspace and promoting peace through strength. He credited the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Zaheer Ahmad Babar, as the main mind behind the operation. \"He (CAS) gave us three tasks: restore deterrence, neutralise threats, and control the air.\"</p>\n<p>Aurangzeb revealed that in the first phase of the response, Pakistan targeted Indian Rafale jets, grounding the fleet near the western border. \"This limited their options and freedom of action,\" he said, adding that India then launched drone attacks on Pakistani civilian areas. However, Pakistan's radar and jamming systems detected and disabled all drones, making them useless.</p>\n<p>Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz said that there was a lot of talk about the Indian aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, coming toward Karachi. \"We tracked it closely from the start. On May 6-7, it was near Bombay, and by May 9, it came within 400 nautical miles of our coast, then turned back.\"</p>\n<p>He explained that if the carrier had come closer, the Pakistan Navy was ready to respond. \"Our maritime air arm was fully prepared, and we stayed in contact with the air force throughout,\" he said.</p>\n<p>\"As a military officer, I don't take the enemy lightly, but let's be realistic. The Vikrant only carries 8-12 MiG-29s, enough for its own defence - not much more,\" he said, adding that the Indian Navy understood the heavy price they would pay if they tried to act from the sea - and that's why they stayed back.</p>\n<p>Rab Nawaz stated that the Pakistan Navy had maintained constant vigilance within its maritime borders and had remained prepared to respond effectively, possessing the capability to deter any enemy intrusion into its territories. He added that the Navy had ensured the ports remained operational during times of tension with India.</p>\n<p>(WITH INPUT FROM APP)</p>\n</span>"

India previously rebuffed his mediation offer and is unlikely to give any positive response to the fresh proposal.</p>\n<p>But the fact that Trump's push for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute punctured the Indian narrative that made desperate attempts over the past few years to portray the Kashmir issue as India's domestic problem.</p>\n<p>Trump used his Truth Social platform to make the offer, saying he was ready to work with India and Pakistan to achieve a \"solution\" for the long-disputed Kashmir region. \"I will work with you, both to see if, after a 'thousand years,' a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,\" Trump said in his post.</p>\n<p>Trump also took credit for the ceasefire announced on Saturday. \"I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,\" he wrote. \"While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations.\"</p>\n<p>Pakistan welcomed Trump's proposal and said that it was ready to work with the United States, seeking resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</p>\n<p>\"We acknowledge with appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India; a step towards de-escalation and regional stability,\" read a statement issued here by the Foreign Office.</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p>\"We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute – a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,\" it said.</p>\n<p>The statement said that Pakistan reaffirmed that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination.</p>\n<p>\"Pakistan remains committed to engaging with the United States and the international community in efforts to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region. We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,\" according to the Foreign Office.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also welcomed the suggestion and showered praise on Trump for \"his path-breaking leadership and commitment to global peace and for his most valuable offer to play a greater role in bringing lasting peace to South Asia.\"</p>\n<p>\"For decades, Pakistan and the US have been partners who worked together closely to protect and promote our mutual interests as well as for peace and security in critical parts of the world,\" Prime Minister Shehbaz wrote on social media platform of X.</p>\n<p>\"I am confident that in President Trump, Pakistan has found a great partner, who can reinvigorate our strategic partnership and strengthen Pakistan-US ties, not only in trade and investment but in all other areas of cooperation,\" Shehbaz added.</p>\n<p>Pakistan and India agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the United States after 5 days of military standoff that brought the two countries on the brink of an all-out war. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio provided details how he along with US Vice President JD Vance worked behind the scenes for 48 hours to persuade both sides to a truce.</p>\n<p>Secretary Rubio revealed that as part of the ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan would hold talks to discuss a broad range of issues at a neutral venue. According to Pakistani officials, the issue of Kashmir and Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) would be on top of the agenda whenever such talks take place.</p>\n<p>India, meanwhile, has yet to react to Secretary Rubio's statement about talks at a neutral venue. India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has long adopted a policy of not holding any talks with Pakistan. If they agree that would be a major departure from their earlier stance.</p>\n</span>"

As an artist, entertainer, and friend,” Ballerini posted to her Instagram Stories. “A deserving queen.”</p><div id=\"div-gpt-story-2\"><script>googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-story-2'); });</script></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the ACM Awards held on May 8, Ballerini was nominated for Entertainer of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Event of the Year (alongside Noah Kahan). All three categories went to other artists, with Wilson taking home two of them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the ceremony, Ballerini shared a photo referencing the iconic “And none for Gretchen Wieners” scene from Mean Girls, prompting mixed reactions online. Her boyfriend, actor Chase Stokes, also posted on Instagram calling her his “Entertainer of the Year.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While some social media users criticized the posts as unprofessional, others defended Ballerini, citing her consistent talent and multiple award show snubs.</p>\n<div data-oembed-url=\"https://x.com/courtlynn3695/status/1920845795521147179\">\n<blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">My fingers slamming the like button on every tweet about Kelsea ballerini getting snubbed AGAIN.

Despite more than a dozen ACM nominations since 2015, she has not won since her early career breakthrough.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Still, Ballerini emphasized that acknowledging loss and celebrating others can go hand in hand. “Two things can be true,” she said in a past statement, highlighting the complexity of awards show emotions.</p>\n</span>"
